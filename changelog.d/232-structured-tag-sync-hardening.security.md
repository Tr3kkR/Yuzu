- **Structured-tag sync hardened: bounded change log, escaped and capped values, atomic persistence** (#232).
  The agent's change log is now bounded at the newest 50 entries in memory as well as on disk, so a
  long-running agent no longer grows it without limit. Synced tag values are capped at 448 bytes (the
  server's own limit, cut on a UTF-8 codepoint boundary) and every field the plugin emits — values, keys,
  and the echoed text of its two error rows — is now escaped with the shared `safe_output_field`, so a
  value containing `|` (for example `Rack A|3`) can no longer shift or forge columns; stored values are
  never rejected or stripped. State is now persisted under the same lock as the change that produced it,
  through a temp file renamed into place (owner-only `0600` on POSIX; Windows keeps the inherited ACL),
  and write failures are logged and reported on `sync` as a `CONSTRAINED` / `PARTIAL` result status with
  provenance `asset_tags:persist_failed` (`sync` previously declared no status). A corrupt or wrong-typed state file
  is now rejected whole with a logged reason, and the agent starts from defaults until the next `sync`
  rewrites it; a malformed `asset_tags.check_interval` is logged instead of silently ignored. Visible on
  upgrade: an existing state file holding more than 50 change entries is trimmed to the newest 50 on load,
  and stored values longer than 448 bytes are capped on load. A stored value that is not valid UTF-8 is
  persisted with U+FFFD in place of each bad byte, so it changes after a restart; a value the server
  accepted is valid UTF-8 and is unaffected.
