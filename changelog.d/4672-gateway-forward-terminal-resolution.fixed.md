- **A command forwarded to a gateway-connected agent now always resolves to a terminal outcome
  instead of getting stuck forever (#4672).** Every gateway-forwarding failure case — the
  mgmt-plane peer pin rejecting this server's certificate; the gateway staying unreachable after
  retries; a target cluster with no configured management address; a response that could not be
  attributed to the intended agent — previously logged the failure and dropped the command
  silently: the executions drawer and any API caller polling that command's status saw it idle at
  RUNNING (or never resolve at all), with no terminal signal. Each of these cases now resolves the
  command to a terminal `FAILURE` with a specific reason code (`gateway_unauthenticated`,
  `gateway_unavailable`, `gateway_unknown_cluster`, `gateway_agent_mismatch`,
  `gateway_forward_failed`), applied through the same path a real gateway response already uses,
  at most once per command across every retry attempt. Durable automatic re-drive with backoff is
  deliberately NOT provided for this path yet — see
  `docs/adr/2002-high-availability-architecture.md` §7e for why, tracked in #4690 — so an operator
  who wants to retry after fixing the underlying cause (a cert/pin mismatch, a missing
  `--gateway-cluster-addr`) currently re-dispatches the command manually.
