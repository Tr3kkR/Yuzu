# changelog.d/ — changelog fragments

**Never edit `CHANGELOG.md` in a PR.** Unreleased changes are recorded here as
one small file per change, and assembled into `CHANGELOG.md` at release time.

Why: two PRs adding bullets to the same `[Unreleased]` section can never
auto-merge — the second one to land always conflicted, and the rebase push
voided the PR's approvals (the dev ruleset requires approval of the most
recent push). Fragments are uniquely-named **new** files, so they can never
conflict with each other. This directory exists to kill that friction.

## What your PR adds

Exactly one new file (more only if the change genuinely spans sections):

```
changelog.d/<PR-or-issue-number>-<short-slug>.<section>.md
```

- `<PR-or-issue-number>` — the PR number if you have it, else the issue
  number. Its only job is uniqueness, so a date works too if neither exists.
- `<short-slug>` — 2–5 words, kebab-case, describing the change.
- `<section>` — where the entry belongs in [Keep a
  Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) terms, one of:
  `added` | `changed` | `deprecated` | `removed` | `fixed` | `security`

**The file body is the finished changelog entry** — one or more markdown
bullets starting with `- `, written exactly as they should appear under
`### Added` (etc.) in `CHANGELOG.md`. Multi-line and multi-paragraph bullets
are fine; match the voice and detail level of existing `CHANGELOG.md` entries.
Do not put `##`/`###` headers in the file — the section comes from the
filename.

### Example

`changelog.d/1832-inventory-devices-tab.added.md`:

```markdown
- **`/inventory` Devices tab shows real device-CI data.** The Serial/Model/CPU-RAM
  columns (previously greyed placeholders) now read from `DeviceInventoryStore`, and
  the per-device drill grows a full CI-record panel.
```

## Rules

1. **Add** your own fragment; **never modify or delete** anyone else's — only
   the release promote removes fragments.
2. Never touch `CHANGELOG.md` itself. A committed Claude Code hook denies the
   edit, and the `Changelog fragments` CI job fails any PR whose diff changes
   the `[Unreleased]` section (the failure message explains how to fix it).
3. Not every PR needs a fragment — pure refactors, CI plumbing, and test-only
   changes with no operator-visible effect can skip it. If an operator or
   agent would notice the change, write one.
4. Lint locally before pushing: `python3 scripts/assemble-changelog.py --check`

## For AI coding agents

If you are an agent (Claude Code, etc.) preparing a change in this repo: when
your instructions, a reviewer, or a checklist says "update the changelog",
that means **create a fragment file here** using the naming scheme above. Do
not open or edit `CHANGELOG.md`. Write the bullet in the same style as
existing `CHANGELOG.md` entries: bolded lead phrase, then the operator-facing
substance, referencing issue/PR numbers like `(#1832)` where relevant.

## Converting a branch that already edited CHANGELOG.md

PRs opened before this convention (or agents that edited `CHANGELOG.md` out of
habit) convert with one short recipe, run from the repo root on the PR branch
(the checkout line brings the tooling onto pre-convention branches):

```bash
git fetch origin dev
git checkout origin/dev -- scripts/assemble-changelog.py changelog.d/README.md
python3 scripts/assemble-changelog.py --extract origin/dev --id <PR#>
```

It moves the bullets your branch added to `[Unreleased]` into correctly-named
fragment files and restores `CHANGELOG.md` to dev's version (so it can no
longer conflict). Review, then commit the new fragment(s) **together with**
the restored `CHANGELOG.md`, and push.

## Release time (operator / release skill only)

`python3 scripts/assemble-changelog.py promote X.Y.Z` merges any legacy
`[Unreleased]` content plus every fragment into a new `## [X.Y.Z] - <date>`
section, resets `[Unreleased]`, and deletes the fragment files; commit the
result. `scripts/release-preflight.sh` fails if unpromoted fragments remain
at tag time. The `/release` skill runs this as part of its pre-tag checklist.
