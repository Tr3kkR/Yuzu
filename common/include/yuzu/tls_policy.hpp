/**
 * tls_policy.hpp -- shared TLS 1.2 cipher allow-list, applied identically to
 * every listener in the process: the gRPC agent/management listeners, the
 * gRPC gateway-command client, and the HTTPS dashboard listener (#4722 Part
 * A; agents/core is Part B, not yet pinned by this header).
 *
 * WHY A PROCESS-ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FOR gRPC. gRPC's public C++ credentials
 * API (`grpc::SslServerCredentialsOptions`, `grpc::SslCredentialsOptions`)
 * has no cipher/ciphersuite setter of its own -- verified against
 * `grpcpp/security/tls_credentials_options.h`, whose experimental
 * `TlsCredentialsOptions` exposes only `set_min_tls_version`/
 * `set_max_tls_version`, no cipher-list method either. The only lever gRPC's
 * OpenSSL/BoringSSL-derived core (`libgrpc`/`libgpr`) exposes is the
 * `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES` environment variable, read once through
 * `grpc_core::ConfigVars` on first use and applied via
 * `SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list` -- confirmed by `nm -u` over every
 * `libgrpc*`/`libgpr` archive in the vcpkg prefix: they reference
 * `SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list` and never `SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites`. That means
 * TLS 1.3 ciphersuite selection is not influenced by this variable (or by
 * anything else gRPC exposes) -- it is always OpenSSL's own default
 * (`TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`,
 * confirmed by `strings` over `libgpr.a`), and `tls_policy_report_lines()`
 * says so explicitly rather than implying this pin covers TLS 1.3 too.
 *
 * ORDERING IS THE CONTRACT: `pin_grpc_cipher_env()` must run before the
 * first gRPC call in the process, because `ConfigVars` snapshots the
 * environment once and never re-reads it. `main.cpp` calls it before
 * constructing `CLI::App` (which is itself before any gRPC symbol runs) --
 * see the ordering-contract comment there. It is an UNCONDITIONAL overwrite:
 * an operator- or container-inherited value for `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES` is
 * never honoured. That is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight --
 * this policy is meant to be the floor, not a tunable an inherited
 * environment can silently loosen.
 *
 * WHY THE LEGACY (NOT EXPERIMENTAL) TLS CREDENTIALS API: settled by Alex for
 * this PR. The experimental `grpc::experimental::TlsServerCredentials`/
 * `TlsCredentialsOptions` API does not close the cipher-setter gap either
 * (see above), so migrating to it would add API-surface churn without
 * buying cipher control. No ADR was written for this (Alex's call) --
 * this comment is the durable record of the decision and its evidence.
 *
 * FIREWALL NOTE (`common/include/` firewall, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md "Project
 * layout"): this header does ONE process-environment write
 * (`pin_grpc_cipher_env()`) plus memory-only OpenSSL `SSL_CTX` calls. No
 * file or socket I/O, no store or wire types, no server-trust-boundary
 * authority -- it selects which ciphers TLS may negotiate, it authenticates
 * nobody. Named as the second exception in both files' firewall annotation
 * alongside `shutdown_watcher.hpp`.
