%%% @doc Genuine multi-node tests for HA WS-4 4.3a intra-cluster routing.
%%%
%%% Every other registry test in this suite runs single-node, where
%%% `node(AnyLocalPid) =:= node()' always holds — the `lookup/1' branch
%%% that distinguishes a REMOTE pg member from a local one, and the
%%% cross-node `pg' group replication it depends on, are UNREACHABLE by a
%%% single-node test no matter how it's written. This module uses OTP's
%%% `peer' module (2 real, connected, distributed BEAM nodes) to actually
%%% exercise that code path — per the design review that shaped this
%%% slice, this is a deliberate empirical requirement, not an aspiration
%%% (see [[feedback-empirically-test-panel-syscall-claims]]-shaped lesson:
%%% assumed distributed-Erlang behaviour is exactly the kind of claim that
%%% needs a real run, not a read of the docs).
%%%
%%% Function calls on the peer go through `erpc:call(PeerNode, ...)' —
%%% real Erlang distribution — NOT `peer:call/4'. `peer:call/4' routes
%%% through `peer''s OWN private control channel, which is only wired up
%%% when `connection => standard_io' is requested; for a plain named,
%%% distributed peer (this module's setup) that channel is `undefined'
%%% and every `peer:call/4' fails `{error, noconnection}' — confirmed
%%% empirically by reading `stdlib/src/peer.erl''s `init/1' (the port is
%%% opened then immediately closed, `Conn = undefined', whenever the
%%% `connection' option isn't `standard_io') before switching to `erpc'.

%% silently stranded the fanout until the 300s `fanout_timeout' fallback,
%% because the node holding the agent process is not necessarily the node
%% that dispatched the command. This test dispatches a command whose
%% "agent" is a peer-node process and asserts the router completes the
%% fanout in bounded time (well under the 300s timeout), not merely that

%%%===================================================================

%% `peer:start_link/1' with a `name' requires the CALLING node to already
%% be a distributed node — `rebar3 eunit' runs a plain, non-distributed
%% `erl' by default, so this must turn the test runner itself into a
%% distributed node (once; idempotent) before the first peer starts.
%%
%% GOVERNANCE FINDING, ROUND 2 (external PR review): the first fix here
%% (replacing a blocking `os:cmd("epmd -daemon")` with a non-blocking
%% `open_port/2` spawn of `epmd.exe -daemon` directly) did NOT resolve the
%% Windows CI hang, and a follow-up `spawn_monitor`+hard-timeout wrapper
%% around the whole bootstrap (round 3) ALSO didn't — two more Windows CI
%% rounds each hung for the FULL 600s meson-level suite timeout with zero
%% test progress printed.
%%
%% GOVERNANCE FINDING, ROUND 3 (Fable/enterprise-architect adjudication,
%% source-verified against OTP's win32 emulator + epmd + erlexec sources):
%% the hang is NOT inside `net_kernel:start/2` or this bootstrap at all —
%% eunit's own `{timeout, 30, ...}` wrapper on every test in this module
%% already bounds an in-test hang (round 1's failure, a clean ~70s partial
%% run with a `timed out` stack trace pointing at the old `os:cmd` call,
%% proves that bound fires correctly). Rounds 2-3's 600s hang is OUTSIDE
%% any test body, which rules out the bootstrap/`peer`/`erpc` calls as the
%% cause. The actual mechanism: `open_port({spawn_executable, Epmd}, ...)`
%% makes `epmd.exe` a PORT CHILD of this BEAM. On Windows, epmd's own
%% `-daemon` handling either re-spawns itself detached (duplicating the
%% port's pipe handles into a parentless grandchild) or runs in-process
%% forever — either way a long-lived external process is now tied to this
%% VM's port table. The round-3 fix's `exit(Pid, kill)` on its bounding
%% worker (or eunit's own kill on a cancelled test) can then hit the win32
%% spawn driver's `stop()` path, which does `TerminateProcess` followed by
%% an INFINITE `WaitForSingleObject` on a pipe-reader thread — uninterruptible
%% if the pipe's far end is held by anything other than the direct port
%% child. A hard timeout around this bootstrap doesn't help: it bounds our
%% own OBSERVATION of the call, not the underlying stuck OS resource, and
%% the kill it issues is plausibly what triggers the wedge in the first
%% place. Fixed by not opening a port to epmd at all — see
%% `ensure_epmd_running/0` below, which uses the same mechanism OTP's own
%% `erlexec` and rebar3's `rebar_dist_utils:start_epmd/0` use on every
%% platform: a short-lived `erl` child process (no inherited pipe handles),
%% waited on to completion rather than fired-and-forgotten via a port.
