%%% @doc Genuine multi-node tests for HA WS-4 `#4555` gateway cluster
%%% formation (ADR-2002 §7b) — a real OTP `peer` connecting via
%%% `yuzu_gw_cluster_discovery`'s actual mechanism, not a mock.
%%%
%%% WHY THIS DOESN'T TEST THE "SAME SHORT NAME" PRODUCTION CONVENTION
%%% DIRECTLY: `yuzu_gw_cluster_discovery:resolve_targets/0` constructs every
%%% dial target as `<this node's own short name>@<resolved address>` — correct
%%% for the real deployment shape (every gateway replica is the identical
%%% image, same short name, different container/address, different EPMD
%%% instance per container). On ONE eunit test host there is exactly ONE
%%% shared EPMD instance, and EPMD registration is keyed by short name ALONE
%%% — two live nodes cannot share a short name on one EPMD regardless of what
%%% host/address string is attached to the name. So the "same short name"
%%% convention is fundamentally untestable with two real peer processes on
%%% one CI host; it is provable only in a genuinely multi-host/multi-container
%%% topology (the HA WS-4 #4555 scale-capable reference Compose rig).
%%%
%%% What IS both real and testable here, and what these tests cover instead:
%%% the mechanism `resolve_targets/0` feeds INTO — `do_tick/1`'s
%%% `net_kernel:connect_node/1` call against a real target actually forms a
%%% distributed connection, and the running gen_server's
%%% `net_kernel:monitor_nodes(true)` wiring actually observes and telemeters
%%% that connection (and its loss) once formed, regardless of which side
%%% initiated it. `do_tick/1` takes an explicit target list precisely so this
%%% suite can pass it a peer's REAL node name directly, sidestepping the
%%% same-short-name construction this file's own module doc explains cannot
%%% be exercised locally.

%% `peer:start_link/1`'s DEFAULT connection mode establishes the origin<->peer
%% distribution connection itself as part of starting up (empirically
%% confirmed — a fresh default-mode peer is already in `nodes()` immediately
%% after `start_peer/0` returns) — the wrong starting state to test do_tick/1
%% FORMING a new connection. `start_disconnected_peer/0` uses
%% `connection => standard_io` instead: the peer's OWN control channel runs
%% over stdio, independent of distribution, so the node starts genuinely
%% NOT distribution-connected AND survives an explicit disconnect (a
%% default-mode peer's control channel IS the distribution link, so
%% disconnecting one self-terminates the peer — empirically confirmed, and
%% the reason this test does not simply disconnect a `start_peer/0` peer
%% instead).

%% immediately, and an empty `cluster_seed_nodes` falls through to a REAL
%% `inet_res:lookup("gateway", in, a)` against the seed DNS name default —
%% on a CI host with a blackholed/absent resolver this can take up to
%% 2s x 3 retries, which could stall this test's own 5s `await_telemetry`
%% bound for reasons having nothing to do with what it's testing. The
