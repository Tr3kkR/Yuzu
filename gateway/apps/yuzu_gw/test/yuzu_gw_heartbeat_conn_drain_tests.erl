%%% @doc Heartbeat admission when an HTTP/2 connection gets GOAWAY.
%%%
%%% Companion to yuzu_gw_heartbeat_conn_rpc_tests: the same REAL grpcbox
%%% listener serving the REAL yuzu_gw_agent_service, driven by REAL grpcbox
%%% client channels over plaintext HTTP/2 (the GOAWAY handling is transport
%%% independent). Characterises what the connection-bound admission rule does
%%% around a GOAWAY, and records what the vendored chatterbox 0.15.1 really
%%% does with one.
%%%
%%% What chatterbox does (h2_connection.erl):
%%%   - every GOAWAY site (listen/handshake timeout, protocol error, settings
%%%     timeout, a received GOAWAY) calls go_away/4 or go_away_/4 and moves the
%%%     connection to the `closing' state. The very next event in `closing'
%%%     closes the socket and stops the process (closing/3). There is no drain:
%%%     streams that were open when GOAWAY was written do not keep running.
%%%   - the client side treats a received GOAWAY the same way (route_frame for
%%%     a stream-0 GOAWAY), so the grpcbox client channel loses the connection
%%%     and its next call opens a NEW connection (a new connection key).
%%%
%%% What follows for admission, asserted below:
%%%   - the binding row is removed when the old Subscribe stream process ends;
%%%     a late heartbeat for that session is rejected as unknown session;
%%%   - a heartbeat that reaches the gateway on a NEW connection while the old
%%%     Subscribe is still bound is rejected as connection mismatch, never
%%%     admitted; chatterbox leaves that window open only for as long as the
%%%     old connection process takes to handle its closing event. The window is
%%%     held open here with sys:suspend/1 on the old connection process, which
%%%     models a slow drain; it is NOT a drain the library performs;
%%%   - the agent's recovery (re-Register, Subscribe on the new connection)
%%%     binds a fresh session to the new connection and ends the rejections.
%%%
%%% The GOAWAY is provoked on the wire by the real client connection process:
%%% it sends a PING frame on stream 1, which the server rejects with a
%%% PROTOCOL_ERROR GOAWAY (h2_connection.erl receive_data, ping on stream /= 0).
%%% Nothing in the gateway is replaced or injected.
%%%
%%% Not covered here, needs the real C++ agent (gRPC core): whether it keeps
%%% the old transport for the open Subscribe stream after GOAWAY and opens a new
%%% connection for the Heartbeat. Against this gateway the old Subscribe ends
%%% as soon as the server connection process handles its closing event.
%%%
%%% Ports are OS-assigned-then-probed with retry (shared CI boxes run several
%%% jobs).
