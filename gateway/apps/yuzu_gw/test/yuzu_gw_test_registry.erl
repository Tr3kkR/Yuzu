%%% @doc Shared EUnit helper: make a real `yuzu_gw_registry' available.
%%%
%%% Every gateway test module that exercises the registry `start_link's
%%% it in its own `setup/0'. Because `start_link' links the registry to
%%% the transient EUnit fixture process, the registry dies when that
%%% module's fixture process exits — and ETS table destruction on owner
%%% death is *asynchronous*. So when the next module's `setup/0' runs
%%% there is a window where `whereis(yuzu_gw_registry) =:= undefined' but
%%% the named tables the dead registry owned (`yuzu_gw_agents' /
%%% `yuzu_gw_pending' / `yuzu_gw_sessions') are not yet reaped. A naive `start_link' in that
%%% window crashes in `init/1' with
%%%
%%%     ets:new(yuzu_gw_pending, ...) → {badarg, ... table name already exists}
%%%
%%% which cancels the whole module's tests (`One or more tests were
%%% cancelled') and reddens CI. The window is timing-dependent and widens
%%% on the self-hosted Windows runner (slower scheduling + Defender I/O
%%% serialisation), which is why it surfaced there intermittently and
%%% cleared on re-run. Issue #1403; documented as `#336' hazard 2 in
%%% `yuzu_gw_registration_replay_tests'.
%%%
%%% A second hazard (#336): `yuzu_gw_health_nf_tests' can leave a
%%% non-gen_server "mock_loop" process registered under the name; reusing
%%% it would hang the next `register_agent' call. `ensure/0' evicts it.
%%%
%%% This module centralises the proven navigation of both hazards so every
%%% registry-using suite shares one correct implementation instead of
%%% re-deriving it (the bug only ever got fixed in one of six setups).
