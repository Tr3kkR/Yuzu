%%% @doc Gateway multi-node cluster FORMATION (HA WS-4 `#4555`, ADR-2002 §7b).
%%%
%%% Owns exactly one thing: whether a mesh of gateway nodes forms and STAYS
%%% formed. It does not know or care about peer health, load, or latency —
%%% that is slice 4.4's `yuzu_gw_cluster` adjacency-table gen_server, layered
%%% on top of the mesh this module maintains.
%%%
%%% ALWAYS-ON, not boot-time-only: `{connect_all, false}` is set in both
%%% `config/sys.config` and `config/sys.config.prod` (deliberately, to avoid
%%% transitive auto-mesh gossip), which means `global`/OTP never self-heals a
%%% partially-connected node set. A node that reaches only some of its
%%% resolvable peers on any given attempt (a peer's epmd up but its own node
%%% not yet registered, a transient DNS timeout, a `net_ticktime` disconnect)
%%% would stay permanently partially-meshed with nothing to ever redial it if
%%% this loop only ran once. So this gen_server ticks on a FIXED interval,
%%% FOREVER, no backoff: each tick resolves the current peer set, subtracts
%%% already-connected nodes (a `net_kernel:connect_node/1` against an
%%% already-connected peer is a harmless no-op, so the steady-state per-tick
%%% cost is one DNS query plus N cheap no-ops), and dials the remainder.
%%%
%%% Fail-open by design: a node that resolves zero peers keeps running
%%% standalone and keeps retrying — this module never refuses to let the
%%% gateway serve the agents already connected to it.
%%%
%%% Redial interval vs. `net_ticktime`: `net_ticktime` (30s, ~120s full
%%% failure-detection window per OTP's own doc — see `config/vm.args.src`'s
%%% comment) governs how long Erlang waits before declaring a node actually
%%% DOWN after a connectivity loss. The default redial interval (5s) is
%%% deliberately much SHORTER than that window: during the window, a redial
%%% attempt against a technically-still-alive-per-Erlang connection is just
%%% another harmless no-op; once `net_ticktime` finally fires `nodedown`, the
%%% NEXT tick (within one interval) reconnects — so this loop heals a real
%%% disconnect promptly without ever fighting the tick-time mechanism.

%% Cap on resolved/configured peer addresses processed IN ONE CALL
%% (round-1 PR review fix). This alone is NOT sufficient to prevent
%% atom-table exhaustion — round-2 review (FortitudeEtc/Kimi+Codex)
%% correctly re-escalated: a hostile/misconfigured seed-name DNS answer
%% returning a FRESH set of <=64 never-before-seen addresses on EVERY
%% tick still grows the atom table unboundedly, just over hours instead
%% of instantly (no single call ever exceeds this cap, so this warning
%% alone would never fire). This constant rate-limits a single
%% oversized answer; `cluster_max_lifetime_addrs` (`?DEFAULT_MAX_LIFETIME_ADDRS` below) is the actual bound
%% that stops unbounded growth. 64 is generously above any realistic
%% cluster size (`docs/erlang-gateway-blueprint.md` sizes ~1M AGENTS per
%% gateway NODE, so a cluster of dozens of nodes is already large).

%% atoms are NEVER garbage-collected; `?MAX_TARGET_ADDRS` above only
%% rate-limits a single call, so it does nothing against a hostile DNS
%% answer that stays under that cap per tick while rotating through an
%% unbounded total set over time (this module's own threat model already
%% treats hostile/misconfigured DNS as adversarial, see
%% `?MIN_COOKIE_LENGTH` in `yuzu_gw_app.erl`). `?SEEN_ADDRS_TABLE` records
%% every address string ever accepted; once this many DISTINCT addresses
%% have been atomized, any genuinely new address is refused outright
%% (never dialed that tick) rather than atomized — degraded, not
%% catastrophic. Runtime-configurable (`cluster_max_lifetime_addrs`,
%% default below) rather than a compile-time constant specifically so a
%% test can exercise the refusal path with a small temporary cap instead
%% of having to permanently exhaust the real one against the
%% process-global, shared `?SEEN_ADDRS_TABLE` (a table sized to the
%% production default would otherwise poison every other test sharing
%% this eunit VM's table for the rest of the run). The production
%% default, 1024, is generously above any realistic deployment's
%% lifetime address churn (container restarts, IP reassignment across
%% the life of one gateway process) and negligible next to the VM's
%% ~1,048,576-entry atom table. A gateway restart resets this counter
%% (the table is process-owned, not persisted) — an attacker forcing
%% restarts to reset it is already bounded by `yuzu_gw_sup`'s own
