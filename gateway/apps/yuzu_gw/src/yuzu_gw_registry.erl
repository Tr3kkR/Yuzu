%%% @doc Agent routing registry — ETS + pg.
%%%
%%% ETS (`yuzu_gw_agents`): fast O(1) lookup by agent_id. Each row also
%%%   carries the verbatim `RegisterRequest` the agent first sent, so
%%%   `yuzu_gw_upstream` can re-proxy it byte-for-byte when the upstream
%%%   connection re-establishes (the server comes back with an empty
%%%   registry and must relearn every agent the gateway already holds).
%%% ETS (`yuzu_gw_pending`): pending Register→Subscribe state with TTL.
%%% ETS (`yuzu_gw_sessions`): session index `{SessionId, AgentId, Pid, ConnKey}`
%%%   for heartbeat admission. ConnKey is the connection key (see
%%%   `yuzu_gw_conn') of the Subscribe stream that created the session, or
%%%   `undefined' for a registration made without one (such a session is held
%%%   but admits no heartbeat). The index is node-local by construction (it
%%%   never consults `pg'); a row is removed with the agent process that owns
%%%   it, and only ever by that process's own session id.
%%% pg (`yuzu_gw` scope):   cluster-aware process groups for broadcast
%%%   and plugin-targeted fanout.
%%%
%%% This gen_server owns the ETS tables and coordinates pg group
%%% membership on behalf of agent processes.

%% to the per-agent `pg' group (`{agent, AgentId}', joined/left alongside the
%% existing `all_agents'/`{plugin, X}' groups below) — `pg' replicates group
%% membership across every CONNECTED distributed-Erlang node in this
%% cluster, giving cross-node location transparency `pg' broadcast groups
%% alone do not provide (see ADR-2002 §7's "per-agent `pg' group, a global
%% registry, or fan-and-filter" mechanism list — this is the first of the
%% three). Deliberately NOT a consistent hash ring: `hash_ring_vnodes'
%% (`gateway/config/sys.config') is for DNS-based connection placement and
%% rebalancing only (`docs/erlang-gateway-blueprint.md`), explicitly NOT
%% command routing — see #4556.
%%
%% SINGLE-MEMBER DISPATCH RULE (load-bearing): `pg' membership is eventually
%% consistent, so during a re-home the OLD node's pid and the NEW node's pid
%% can both be members of `{agent, AgentId}' until the old stream process
%% actually exits. Dispatching to EVERY member would let one command yield
%% TWO responses (a real one plus an `agent_disconnected' from the dead
%% pid) for a single fanout target. Never happens today (agent reconnect is
%% the only re-home path, ADR-2002 §7 — a physical stream move is always
%% agent-reconnect-shaped, so at most one live member should exist at
%% steady state), but the rule holds regardless: pick exactly ONE —
%% preferring a LOCAL member if any (so `is_process_alive/1`'s liveness
%% check still applies) — never dispatch to more than one.
