%%% @doc Admission decision for agent Heartbeat calls.
%%%
%%% A heartbeat is admitted only for a session this node holds, and only
%%% when it arrives on the HTTP/2 connection the session is bound to:
%%%   - an established session is bound to the connection of the Subscribe
%%%     stream that created it;
%%%   - a session that has registered but not yet subscribed is bound to
%%%     the connection that performed the Register.
%%% Anything else is rejected. The decision reads node-local state only
%%% (`yuzu_gw_registry:lookup_session/1' and `lookup_pending_session/1',
%%% never `pg'); it does not depend on the upstream server's view of the
%%% session. A missing registry table fails closed.
%%%
%%% Every rejection is counted (`yuzu_gw_heartbeat_rejected_total{reason}',
%%% or `yuzu_gw_heartbeat_session_mismatch_total{event="security"}' for a
%%% held session arriving on a different connection) and folded into a
%%% rate-limited summary log line. There is no per-heartbeat log and no
%%% log line ever carries a session id.
%%%
%%% The caller answers every rejection with the same NOT_FOUND
%%% "unknown session" regardless of reason.
