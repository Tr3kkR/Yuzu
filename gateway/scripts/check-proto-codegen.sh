# check-proto-codegen.sh — F-3 (#1243): fail if the committed gateway protobuf
# modules (apps/yuzu_gw/src/*_pb.erl) have drifted from priv/proto.
#
# Why this exists: the gateway carries its OWN gpb-generated copies of the proto
# modules (separate from the server's protoc output). gpb modules are
# self-contained — if a field is added to a .proto but a module is not
# regenerated, the gateway silently stops carrying that field across transit
# (this is exactly the per-agent-enrollment CSR field-drop bug PR5 fixed). This
# guard converts that silent drift into a hard CI failure.
#
# How: regenerate every top-level proto with the EXACT gpb_opts read from
# rebar.config (via file:consult, so the guard cannot drift from the build's own
# options) into a temp dir, then byte-diff against the committed modules. gpb is
# version-pinned in rebar.config (4.21.7) + target_erlang_version is fixed, so
# the output is deterministic and reproducible across machines.
#
# It ALSO guards flat<->nested mirror drift: each .proto exists as a flat top-level
# copy (priv/proto/<x>.proto, the regen source for <x>_pb) AND a package-pathed
# copy (priv/proto/yuzu/<pkg>/v1/<x>.proto, the import target gpb resolves when
# another proto does `import "yuzu/<pkg>/v1/<x>.proto"`). gateway.proto and
# management.proto import the nested agent.proto, so gateway_pb/management_pb are
# generated from the nested copy while agent_pb comes from the flat copy — if the
# two copies' message defs diverge, agent_pb carries a field the gateway proxy
# drops. The top-level regen above cannot see this (it only reads the flat copy),
# so the nested loop below generates each nested copy and byte-diffs its module
# against the flat-generated one (gpb strips comments, so comment-only differences
# between the copies are ignored — only structure is compared).
#
# Prereq: `rebar3 compile` (or any rebar3 run that fetches deps) must have
# populated _build so gpb's ebin is available. CI runs this right after the
# gateway compile step.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/check-proto-codegen.sh   (from the gateway/ dir or anywhere)

# common) — a divergence there is what skews agent_pb from the copy gateway_pb/
# management_pb embed. The gateway/management pairs are drift-invariant to the
# agent copy (both their flat and nested forms import the SAME nested agent.proto),
# so those pairs only catch drift between a wrapper proto's own two copies. gpb
# output is comment- and whitespace-free, so comment-only differences between the
# copies (which exist today) are ignored — only message/field structure compares.
