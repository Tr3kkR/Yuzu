/**
 * scim_store.hpp — storage layer for SCIM v2 provisioning (slice 1),
 * born-on-Postgres (ADR-0006, schema `scim_store`).
 *
 * Maps the IdP-facing SCIM `id` / `externalId` to a Yuzu username, and holds
 * the SCIM bearer credential(s) as sha256 hashes only — mirrors
 * `ApiTokenStore`'s token-hashing pattern (server/core/src/api_token_store.cpp).
 * SCIM tokens stay verify-only hashes (no `SecretCodec` — there is no
 * plaintext to envelope-encrypt; a hash cannot be decrypted back to a raw
 * bearer value the way a `SecretCodec` blob can).
 *
 * Posture (ADR-0012 §1): FRESH START, no `migrate_from_sqlite()` — this is a
 * greenfield born-on-PG store (no prior release shipped a Postgres SCIM
 * store to backfill from); any pre-existing `auth.db`-resident SCIM mappings
 * are not carried forward. Construction is fail-CLOSED: `is_open()` is false
 * if the pool lease or schema migration fails, and server.cpp treats that as
 * a fatal startup error (same pattern as every other born-on-PG store).
 * Runtime reads/mutations degrade to the empty/false/nullopt value the
 * existing (SQLite-era) callers already treat as "operation did not
 * succeed" — `scim_routes.cpp` (a separate, un-touched slice) already
 * handles that outcome as a 5xx, so this store keeps the same signatures
 * rather than introducing a parallel `std::expected` surface here.
 *
 * Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&` (not a
 * `sqlite3*`), runs its migration at construction on a pinned lease,
 * schema-qualifies every runtime statement (`scim_store.scim_resources`,
 * `scim_store.scim_tokens`, `scim_store.scim_groups`,
 * `scim_store.scim_group_members`), and uses `RETURNING` for
 * mutate-and-return (never `sqlite3_changes()`/row-count polling, #1033).
 * Bounded `try_acquire_for` leases on every runtime path.
 *
 * NO per-connection `db_mtx_` anymore (the SQLite single-handle serialization
 * this store used to rely on) — a `PgPool` hands out independent connections
 * per lease, same as every other born-on-PG store. `scim_routes.cpp`'s
 * `recompute_scim_user_role` doc comment references a "LOCK ORDER ...
 * ScimStore::db_mtx_" that predates this port; that comment is stale as of
 * this port (member removed) and is out of this store's scope to fix
 * (routes layer, not touched here) — flagged for the routes owner.
 *
 * This class does NOT implement any HTTP/REST route or JSON codec — it is
 * the data + token layer only (slice 1 of 3; a sibling junior owns the JSON
 * codec, another owns the routes).
 *
 * SCIM v2 Groups (#2021, slice 2): schema version 2 adds `scim_groups` +
 * the `scim_group_members` join table, and this class exposes group CRUD +
 * membership management + the `list_group_display_names_for_user` reverse
 * lookup a later, separate task consumes to map SCIM groups to Yuzu roles.
 * Still no HTTP/REST route, JSON codec, or role-application logic here.

    // Records every OIDC login's attempted CANDIDATE claim value(s) —
    // regardless of whether any of them matched a SCIM resource — so a
    // later deprovision can surface a should-have-matched candidate under a
    // misconfigured `--oidc-scim-link-claim` (a real, actionable "your link
    // claim is wrong for this IdP" signal instead of a silent gap). Callers
    // record one row PER CANDIDATE claim (`sub` and, when present, `oid`),
    // not just the configured link claim — governance Gate 7 BLOCKING fix:
    // under the prior (iss, sub)-only key, only the configured claim's
    // value survived the upsert, so a login presenting the OTHER candidate
    // (the exact "operator configured the wrong claim" case) left nothing
    // for `observation_matches` to find.

    /// Idempotent upsert keyed `(iss, sub, claim_name)` — one observation
    /// PER CANDIDATE CLAIM per identity, refreshed on every login (a login
    /// that presents both `sub` and `oid` upserts two rows). Returns false
    /// on db failure or an empty `iss`/`sub`/`claim_name`.

    /// `claim_value` — the D2 "did any login present a candidate that
    /// should have matched" signal. This is a best-effort detection signal,

    /// read collapses to `false` rather than a tri-state failure — treating
    /// "cannot tell" as "no candidate seen" is the safe direction for a
    /// signal that only ever ADDS a human-facing hint, never gates access.
