/// @file plugin_config_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres plugin configuration/secret plane + per-action kill
/// switch (PR1.5b). Schema `plugin_config_store` (ADR-0008 naming rule:
/// snake_case of the FULL class name including `Store`). Follows
/// `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md` §"Recipe — a new (greenfield) store"
/// exactly — `offline_endpoint_store.hpp`/`auth_db.cpp` are the two worked
/// references this store's shape is drawn from.
///
/// Posture: AUTHORITATIVE (ADR-0012 §1). This is config/secret/kill-switch
/// data — there is no in-memory layer that could stand in as "the real
/// answer" the way `OfflineEndpointStore`'s durability-on-top posture
/// assumes. Every read returns a typed `std::expected<T, Error>` (ADR-0036):
/// a genuine "no rows" is a value (possibly empty), a runtime DB failure is
/// `unexpected(Error::...)` — the two are never collapsed. The kill-switch
/// evaluation entrypoint (`action_allowed`) goes one step further and
/// collapses ITS OWN error case to `false` (disabled) internally, precisely
/// because that decision feeds a dispatch gate where a silently-empty/false
/// answer would be misread as "not killed" (see its doc comment).
///
/// Three row kinds, three tables, one schema:
///   - `configs`       — plain `<plugin>.<key>` -> value. Freely readable.
///   - `secrets`       — sealed `<plugin>.<key>` -> `SecretCodec` envelope.
///     WRITE-ONLY: no method on this store, anywhere, returns a secret's
///     plaintext — `set_secret`'s own return value is metadata
///     (`SecretMeta`, which structurally has no value field), never an echo
///     of what it just sealed.
///   - `kill_switches` — `<plugin>` or `<plugin>.<action>` -> enabled +
///     reason + who. Absence of a row means "enabled" (not killed) — a row
///     is written only once an operator has explicitly flipped the switch.
///
/// ADR-0010 secret handling — one `SecretCodec` instance per store (the
/// playbook's "Instance model", `AuthDB` is the worked precedent this
/// mirrors): the CALLER constructs the codec and this ctor registers this
/// store's own secret column (`plugin_config_store.secrets.sealed_value`,
/// pk `scope_key` — a deterministic `<plugin>.<key>` TEXT identity, not the
/// numeric `id`; see `set_secret`'s doc comment for why) immediately, so
/// `SecretCodec::init()` (which the caller runs right after this ctor
/// returns, per the playbook's register-before-init sequencing) validates
/// it.
///
/// KEK-rotation-surface enrolment (#2568/#2580) — NOT fully closed by this
/// package: registering the column makes it eligible for `rotate`/`rewrap`,
/// but the LIVE rotate/rewrap endpoints (`kek_routes.hpp`, `server.cpp`)
/// today invoke those operations on `auth_secret_codec_` specifically, not
/// on an arbitrary registered codec. `server.cpp` is out of this package's
/// owned files (boundary discipline), so actually wiring this store's own
/// codec instance into the live rotate/rewrap call path — so an operator's
/// `/rotate` or `/rewrap` request also re-wraps `secrets.sealed_value` — is
/// the constructing/wiring PR's job, exactly like the rest of this store's
/// server.cpp wiring. Recorded as an explicit open item in
/// `docs/adr/3005-plugin-config-store.md` rather than left implicit.
///
/// See `docs/adr/3005-plugin-config-store.md` for the full record: schema,
/// posture, secret handling, KEK enrolment, and the open agent-side secret-
/// delivery gap this package deliberately leaves unclosed.
