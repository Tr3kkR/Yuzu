/// @file cpe_identity_resolver.hpp
/// CpeIdentityResolver (PR 3, ADR-0018) — a PURE, self-contained unit: given
/// ONE installed-software record, decide its lane and, for Lane-1 distro
/// packages, resolve it to a `(cpe_product, confidence)` CPE identity or emit a
/// stable not-assessed reason. NO store, NO NVD, NO engine, NO Postgres. It
/// produces exactly what the future PR-4 engine will feed into
/// `NvdDatabase::assess()`.
///
/// The curated map is security-relevant — a wrong mapping produces wrong
/// findings — which is why it is isolated here and fail-closed (a too-small
/// embed refuses to construct).
///
/// ==========================================================================
/// THE RESOLVED MATCHING MODEL (B1/B2) — READ BEFORE WIRING A DOWNSTREAM QUERY
/// ==========================================================================
/// A curated hit emits an EXACT PRODUCT plus a vendor that is **DISPLAY /
/// provenance ONLY**. `cpe_vendor` MUST NOT gate the downstream match.
///
/// This is deliberate. `NvdDatabase::assess()` (PR 1) matches on product
/// (+ optional vendor). The entire value of the curated map is fixing the
/// PRODUCT token (`libssl3` -> `openssl`), NOT narrowing the vendor. Emitting a
/// vendor into the query would re-introduce the vendor-drift MISS: NVD carries
/// the same product under multiple vendors (e.g. curl as both `haxx:curl` and
/// `curl:curl`). So a downstream `CpeQuery` built from a `ResolvedIdentity`
/// MUST set `vendor=""` and match on `cpe_product` — `cpe_vendor` is carried
/// for provenance/display only.
///
/// Monotonicity: a curated exact-product is a strict improvement over the
/// uncurated name-prefix baseline; it can never regress below it.
