///
/// Deadline enforcement for in-flight OTA `DownloadUpdate` transfers (issue
/// #911, UP-101).
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. `AgentServiceImpl` is a SYNCHRONOUS gRPC service
/// (`: public pb::AgentService::Service`), and `grpc::ServerWriter::Write` on the
/// sync API takes no deadline. A peer that collapses its HTTP/2 receive window to
/// zero and then keeps ACKing keepalive pings blocks that `Write` indefinitely —
/// keepalive does not catch it, because the connection is live; only the STREAM is
/// stalled. An elapsed-time check between chunks catches the slow-drip case, where
/// each `Write` completes slowly, but it can never catch a single `Write` that
/// never returns: the handler thread is inside the call and cannot check anything.
///
/// The only mechanism that unblocks it is cancelling the RPC from ANOTHER thread —
/// `grpc::ServerContext::TryCancel()`, after which the blocked `Write` returns
/// false and the handler unwinds normally. That is what this watchdog does.
///
/// WHY A CancelFn AND NOT A ServerContext*. The registration takes an opaque
/// callback rather than a `grpc::ServerContext*` so the deadline bookkeeping is
/// unit-testable without a live gRPC call: a default-constructed `ServerContext`
/// is not attached to a call, and calling `TryCancel()` on one is not a contract
/// gRPC documents. Production registers `[ctx] { ctx->TryCancel(); }`; tests
/// register a lambda that sets a flag. It also keeps this file free of gRPC types.
///
/// LIFETIME — the load-bearing part. The agent learned this exact lesson the hard
/// way in `cancel_ctx()` (`agents/core/src/agent.cpp`): a canceller that sits
/// between loading a context pointer and calling TryCancel on it has a
/// use-after-free, because the frame owning the context can return in between. So:
///
///   * The registration is a move-only RAII handle living in the handler's frame.
///     It erases its entry on destruction, i.e. before the handler returns and
///     therefore before gRPC tears the context down.
///   * The sweeper holds `mu_` ACROSS the lookup AND the cancel call. Erase also
///     takes `mu_`. A handler returning therefore cannot race a sweep already
///     dereferencing its callback — it blocks until the sweep finishes.
///   * Lock ordering is one-way: this class takes `mu_` and then (inside the
///     callback) gRPC's internal context lock. Nothing anywhere takes gRPC's lock
///     and then `mu_`, so the pair cannot deadlock. Do not add a path that does.
///
/// TryCancel is non-blocking (it signals the call; it does not wait for the
/// handler), so holding `mu_` across it does not stall other registrations.
