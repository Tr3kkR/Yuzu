/// @file dex_api.hpp
/// The FIFTH per-family in-process API seam for the presentation/core/engine
/// split (ADR-0031, WS-A4), covering the DEX **signals / experience-score**
/// surface — the GuaranteedStateStore-backed `/api/v1/dex/*` resources.
/// Abstract, ZERO store-shaped dependencies — it includes only the pure
/// `dex_read_model.hpp` (pure model structs + model-only serializers, which
/// pulls `dex_types.hpp`, the relocated DEX leaf PODs) + std. Its transitive
/// include closure NAMES NO STORE TYPE (`GuaranteedStateStore`,
/// `AppPerfDailyRow`, …) — matching its four sibling abstract headers and
/// enforced by check-seam-closure.py's abstract-header store-type probe. This
/// held only after PR #4582 split the store-reaching `build_dex_*_model(...)`
/// builders out of `dex_read_model.hpp` into the core-only
/// `dex_read_builders.hpp`; before that this header transitively named
/// `GuaranteedStateStore`. So a future presentation-side client can include
/// this without dragging the server's `guaranteed_state_store.hpp` (a
/// CATASTROPHIC Guardian/Guaranteed-State header) or `dex_routes.hpp` (which
/// pulls `<httplib.h>`) along.
///
/// Each method == ONE public DEX signals resource so a presentation/MCP caller
/// consumes only what the public, versioned core API serves (ADR-0031 B3,
/// INV-31-4 "no private core API") — a local in-process implementation today
/// (`LocalDexApi`, dex_api.cpp), a core HTTP client after the WS-B2 cutover.
/// Adding a method here without a corresponding public REST/MCP resource would
/// reintroduce a private core API and defeat the seam.
///
/// SCOPE — this seam fronts the DEX **signals / experience-score** resources:
/// the per-device experience score + signal summary, the fleet signal rollup /
/// per-signal drill / per-OS coverage, the app blast-radius / stability list,
/// the catalogue-group / health / trends / overview read models, and the raw
/// per-device signal history + single-observation detail. The cut is by
/// RESOURCE sub-namespace + DATA CLASS (identity/experience signal reads),
/// distinct from the app-perf-over-time percentile-series class below.
///
/// Deliberately NOT in this seam:
///   - `GET /api/v1/dex/perf/compare` is ALREADY the `VerifyApi` seam (the
///     `/auto` VERIFY before/after comparison) — NOT a future surface.
///   - the remaining `/api/v1/dex/perf/*` resources and
///     `GET /api/v1/dex/devices/{id}/app-perf` are the app-perf-over-time
///     (percentile-series) data class — the planned `DexPerfApi` (Seam 2).
///   - `GET /api/v1/dex/devices/{id}/live` is a bounded live-registry poll, not
///     a stored read at all (its own tiny seam later).
///
/// The store-backed factory (`make_local_dex_api`) lives in the core-only
/// `dex_api_local.hpp` — this header names no store type at all.
///
/// ── DERIVATION CONTRACT (why the method params are what they are) ──
/// The impl derives `since` from `window` via
/// `dex_iso_since(dex_window_to_days(window))` and obtains the cross-store
/// `DexFleet` denominator from an injected `FleetFn` — exactly as today's
/// handlers do — so neither `since` nor `DexFleet` appears in this abstract
/// interface. `visible` (the caller's ADR-0017 admit-then-filter set) DOES
/// appear where a resource confines its device list: it is resolved from the
/// authenticated request by the handler (`resolve_dex_visible`) and threaded
/// in, since it depends on the caller's identity, not the store.
