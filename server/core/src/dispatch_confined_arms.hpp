/// @file dispatch_confined_arms.hpp
/// The ONE place a dispatch arm's VISIBLE-SET INTERSECTION is decided (#1788).
///
/// THE RULE, stated once: every arm — an explicit id list, a management group,
/// a scope expression, a named `__all__` broadcast — is a TARGETING mechanism,
/// never an authz exemption. Each resolves to a candidate set, and every
/// candidate set is intersected with the caller's `Execution:Execute` visible
/// set immediately before the send.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE, PURE FUNCTION and not just a shared member: the
/// callers legitimately DIFFER in how they resolve targets and report failure.
/// `ServerImpl::dispatch_confined` recovers a scope principal from the
/// execution row and has no `res` to write to (background runners call it);
/// the `/api/command` handler reads the live session and answers 400/503 on a
/// bad scope. Those differences are real and are why one closure could not
/// simply absorb the other. But the part that MUST NOT DRIFT is not the
/// resolution — it is the intersection, and that part is identical. So each
/// caller keeps its own resolution and error shaping, and both route the
/// decision of WHO IS ACTUALLY REACHED through here.
///
/// The routed concern (.claude/routed-concerns.md, "Dispatch targeting") says a
/// second copy of the shared rule is how the identical defect survived on REST
/// after MCP was fixed. Two byte-identical copies of the four-arm intersection
/// existed before this header; a future arm added to one and not the other is
/// precisely the drift it warns about.
///
/// Being dependency-injected, this is also the seam the confinement tests bind:
/// a fake sink records exactly who was reached, so a test FAILS when any single
/// `in_scope`/`filter_to_scope` call is removed. Route-level mocks that merely
/// observe the VisibleSet being handed over cannot do that (CDX-R8-02) — they
/// stay green while the intersection is deleted.
///
/// #881 — QUARANTINE CONTAINMENT is gated HERE too, for the identical reason
/// #1788's visible-set intersection is: a per-route quarantine check is how
/// the next identical defect survives on whichever route is added after this
/// one. `ContainmentGate` is a SECOND, orthogonal filter applied AFTER the
/// #1788 intersection and BEFORE the send — authz decides WHO MAY be
/// targeted, containment decides WHO MAY be REACHED RIGHT NOW, and neither
/// one substitutes for the other. Every arm applies it, including the
/// `send_to_all_unfiltered` fast path: an unfiltered caller (`exec_visible ==
/// nullopt`, e.g. every `system`-caller dispatch) is exactly the caller most
/// likely to reach a quarantined agent if this gate were route-scoped instead
/// of chokepoint-scoped, because it is the one path that was never filtered
/// by anything else. `ContainmentGate::enforced == false` is a pure no-op —
/// reserved for the quarantine plugin's OWN control channel, so lifting a
/// quarantine can never be blocked by the quarantine it is lifting.
