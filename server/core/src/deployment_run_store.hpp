/// @file deployment_run_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres store (ADR-0006, schema `deployment_run_store`) for the `/auto`
/// DEPLOY stage — the persistence behind a deployment run and its per-device
/// stage→execute state machine. Twin of PreflightRunStore, but the device step is
/// STATEFUL (mutating), so this store does NOT recompute a grid: it exposes
/// GUARDED ONE-WAY TRANSITIONS (each UPDATE keys on the expected source step), and
/// the execute step is CLAIMED before dispatch (`claim_for_exec`: staged→executing
/// RETURNING) so an installer runs AT MOST ONCE per device even under concurrent
/// advances / a server restart (the claim commits before the execute leaves the
/// server).
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012): CONSTRUCTION is fail-CLOSED (a reachable DB whose schema
/// can't migrate sets startup_failed_ in server.cpp — same as PreflightRunStore).
/// RUNTIME is durability-on-top — a transient lease/query error degrades the page
/// to an honest note, never blocks the gRPC hot path. Owner scoping: `created_by`
/// is frozen at creation; reads pass the viewer so a not-yours deployment is
/// indistinguishable from not-found. RETURNING is the mutate-and-return idiom; a
/// lease is NEVER held across a dispatch (the engine owns that ordering).
///
/// Two tables:
///   * deployments       — artifact spec + source pre-flight run + lifecycle + counts.
///   * deployment_device — PK(deployment_id, agent_id); hostname/os FROZEN at create
///                         (the cohort = denominator + owner-scoped read surface);
///                         step/exit_code/error advanced by the guarded transitions.
