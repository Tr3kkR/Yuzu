/// @file device_inventory_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres typed device-CI projection (ADR-0016, schema
/// `device_inventory_store`). The read-optimized home for the daily-sync
/// framework's `device_ci` source — one row per agent holding the machine's
/// stable hardware / OS identity (a ServiceNow-CMDB-style configuration item),
/// so a device's asset record survives offline.
///
/// COEXISTS with `SoftwareInventoryStore` (the `installed_software` projection)
/// and `AppPerfDailyStore` (`app_perf`) — each daily-sync source that needs typed
/// fleet reads gets its own born-on-PG store. Device-CI is **1:1 per agent**
/// (unlike software's 1:N rows), so the projection is a single table, replaced
/// wholesale on change.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement, uses
/// `RETURNING`. Normalized columns only — NO JSONB. Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1 /
/// ADR-0016 §7):
///   - **Ingest:** fail-soft — a transient PG outage returns kError + nacks; the
///     next sync + the weekly full-floor self-heal.
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — a store/pool/query failure is reported as
///     `kDegraded` (reads) / `std::nullopt` (list), NEVER a silent empty (an empty
///     CI roster reads as "no devices", the fail-open ADR-0016 §7 forbids).
///   - `last_seen`/`first_seen` are the **SERVER receipt time**, never the
///     agent-supplied `collected_at` (the #1685 lesson, baked in from day one).
