/// @file pg_migration_runner.hpp
/// Postgres port of `MigrationRunner` (ADR-0008 "Migrations" +
/// "Namespacing"): numbered `{version, sql}` migrations registered in C++
/// next to each store, applied against a shared
/// `public.schema_meta(store, version, upgraded_at)` table, with one
/// Postgres SCHEMA per store namespace.
///
/// Differences from the SQLite runner that callers must know:
///  - The runner creates `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS <store>` and runs each
///    migration with `SET LOCAL search_path TO <store>, public` — so a
///    migration's unqualified `CREATE TABLE items (...)` lands in the
///    store's own schema. The setting is transaction-local (`SET LOCAL`);
///    nothing leaks onto the pooled connection.
///  - At runtime (outside migrations) stores must schema-qualify their table
///    names (`SELECT ... FROM response.items`) — pooled connections carry no
///    per-store search_path.
///  - Concurrent runners (two server processes against one database) are
///    serialized per store via a transaction-scoped advisory lock, and the
///    applied version is re-read under that lock — the loser of the race
///    sees the winner's version and skips.
///  - Store names are SQL identifiers here, so they are restricted to
///    `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*`, max 63 bytes, excluding the reserved namespaces
///    `public`, `information_schema`, and the `pg_` prefix. Anything else
///    is rejected.
///
/// Future-evolution note (mirrors the SQLite runner's ALTER-TABLE note):
/// every migration runs inside a transaction, and the search_path
/// mechanism REQUIRES that (`SET LOCAL` reverts at txn end). Statements
/// that cannot run in a transaction block — `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`,
/// `VACUUM`, `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` (pre-12 semantics) — cannot be
/// expressed as a `PgMigration`. When a store needs one (likely for the
/// response/audit-scale indexes), add an explicit non-transactional
/// migration kind that schema-qualifies its table names instead of relying
/// on search_path; do not weaken the transactional default.
