/// @file multi_host_dsn.hpp
/// HA WS-8: the server refuses to run a multi-host Postgres DSN that could put
/// its connections on a server that cannot take writes.
///
/// WHY. With `host=n1,n2,n3` and no `target_session_attrs`, libpq takes the
/// FIRST host that accepts a connection — a standby included. The pool then
/// holds connections whose writes fail, and nothing the `/readyz` probe does can
/// see all of them (it holds one connection; the pool holds many, possibly on
/// different hosts). Governance rounds 2–4 of WS-8 found four HIGH false-green
/// shapes, all this one root cause. The documented HA pattern
/// (docs/user-manual/ha-postgres.md) already sets
/// `target_session_attrs=read-write`; this makes it the enforced behaviour.
///
/// POLICY (operator decisions, 2026-09-24):
///   - an EMPTY DSN: unchanged (the server refuses to start on it, ADR-0007);
///   - `load_balance_hosts` set to anything but `disable` (in the DSN or
///     `PGLOADBALANCEHOSTS`), with any number of hosts: REFUSED. libpq would
///     shuffle hosts and addresses for every new pool connection while the
///     /readyz probe holds one connection, so a host failing some new
///     connections could never show; with read-write only one host is
///     acceptable, so the shuffle balances nothing (Gate 8 round 6);
///   - one host: unchanged;
///   - multi-host with NO `target_session_attrs` (or an empty one): the DSN is
///     REBUILT as a keyword/value DSN from libpq's own parse, every value
///     quoted, with `target_session_attrs=read-write` added, and re-parsed to
///     prove every other option is unchanged — never string-appended (Gate 8
///     round 5: an unquoted trailing `\`, a raw `?` in a URI password, or a URI
///     ending in `?`/`&` each defeated or broke an append). A DSN keyword
///     overrides a `PGTARGETSESSIONATTRS` environment value, so the
///     environment cannot weaken it;
///   - multi-host with `read-write` or `primary`: unchanged;
///   - multi-host with any other value (`any`, `read-only`, `standby`,
///     `prefer-standby`, or anything unrecognised): REFUSED — the caller exits
///     with the returned message.
/// A host list that arrives through `PGHOST`/`PGHOSTADDR` counts. What only
/// libpq sees — a `service=`/`PGSERVICE` entry (or anything else resolved at
/// connect time) — is checked by `check_effective_connection` on the first
/// pooled connection at boot (Gate 8 round 7: a service-file
/// `load_balance_hosts=random` bypassed this DSN-only check). Residual, not
/// seen by either: a SINGLE host name that resolves to several servers (DNS
/// round-robin, a headless service) — set `target_session_attrs=read-write`
/// explicitly for those.
///
/// The error message never contains the DSN (it can carry a password), and
/// echoes the offending `target_session_attrs` / `load_balance_hosts` value
/// only when it is one of libpq's own values.
