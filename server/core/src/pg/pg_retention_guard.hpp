/// WS-10 (#2508): the clock-guarded, SINGLE-WRITER-safe retention DELETE for
/// Postgres stores, as ONE reviewed implementation the #2508 prunes share
/// (`app_perf_fleet_store`, `preflight_run_store`, `deployment_run_store`).
///
/// WHY SHARED, not copied per store. The routed "clock-guarded retention" concern
/// says "copy the SHAPE, never the numbers." The three #2508 targets are
/// structurally identical Postgres retention deletes differing ONLY in table,
/// timestamp column/unit, and their substrate-tuned constants — so this helper IS
/// the shape, and every number is a per-store parameter (`ClockGuardedPruneSpec`).
/// For catastrophic-if-wrong retention code, one implementation exercised by an
/// exhaustive table test is strictly safer to verify than three hand-copies, and
/// it matches the codebase's single-chokepoint discipline
/// (`dispatch_confined_arms`, `authz_topology_floor`, `body_cap_policy`). The
/// pure decision rule stays the shared `audit_retention::classify` (part 6's
/// "record which way you went" is the per-call-site `missing_anchor` choice +
/// comment; it is NOT hidden in here).
///
/// The seven parts (all implemented here; the reference is
/// `execution_tracker.cpp::reconcile_stale_concurrency_claims` + `audit_store`):
///   1. probe by OUTCOME (would-wipe), excluding implausibly-future rows via a
///      PER-STORE `implausibility_bound` — a FORWARD-SKEW ceiling, NOT a TTL
///      relationship: a row stamped more than `now + bound` ahead is treated as
///      clock-skew noise and dropped from the would-wipe denominator. The #2508
///      columns (`created_at_ms`, `day`) are PAST-dated — a legitimate row is
///      never future — so a small bound (1 day) is correct and a large one would
///      WEAKEN the guard (one far-future row would veto `would_wipe` forever).
///      (Contrast `audit_store`, whose `now + window + slack` horizon is right
///      because ITS column is a FUTURE expiry; that relationship is inapplicable
///      here — do not import it.);
///   2. a PERSISTED clock reading in `retention_meta` (survives restarts);
///   3. SANITISE it — below `min_plausible_reading` (negative/garbage) OR
///      ahead-of-now (a backward shared-clock step) → prev_unusable/BadState,
///      never a quiet re-stamp (mirrors `AuditStore`'s `*prev < 0 || *prev > now`);
///   4. SUPPRESS only a repeat of the SAME full fact set;
///   5. cap every accepted pass UNCONDITIONALLY (`cap_per_pass` LIMIT);
///   6. a DELIBERATE missing-anchor decision (`MissingAnchorPolicy`), recorded
///      at the call site;
///   7. absolute elapsed-time step floor (`big_step_floor`, in the column's unit).
/// SINGLE-WRITER: the whole probe-decide-delete runs in ONE txn whose first
/// statement is `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(advisory_lock_key)` — a replica that
/// loses the race skips this tick (another drains it; the anchor advances on the
/// winner), so N replicas never race the anchor or the delete. The clock is read
/// from Postgres `now()` in-SQL (the shared clock, #3715), never a replica's
/// `system_clock`, so cross-host skew cannot split the guard.
///
/// UNIT-AGNOSTIC. Everything is expressed in the timestamp COLUMN's native unit,
/// so `now_expr` yields the current time in that unit and `retention_window`,
/// `big_step_floor`, `implausibility_bound` and `min_plausible_reading` are all in
/// that same unit. The two units in use today are BOTH epoch-derived integers:
/// milliseconds for `created_at_ms` (preflight/deployment) and day-floored
/// unix-SECONDS for `app_perf`'s `day` column (a bucket like
/// `(epoch_secs/86400)*86400`, so its `now_expr` is raw epoch seconds, NOT a
/// day-NUMBER). A future store with a true day-number column would need its own
/// `/86400` now_expr and matching constants — do not copy an existing example blind.
///
/// TRUSTED-CONSTANTS CONTRACT (catastrophic — this is a retention chokepoint).
/// The SQL-identifier / SQL-expression spec fields (`target_table`, `ts_column`,
/// `now_expr`, `meta_table`, `*_key`, `advisory_lock_key`) are string-interpolated
/// into the SQL, NOT bound as parameters (an identifier cannot be a `$` param).
/// Every one MUST be a compile-time constant authored at the call site and MUST
/// NEVER carry caller/attacker-controlled input — a runtime-derived value in any
/// of them is a server-side SQL-injection vector. Only the numeric values
/// (`retention_window` → `cutoff`, `cap_per_pass`) are runtime, and those are
/// bound as `$N` params. EXTEND this helper for a new store by adding a call site
/// with constant fields; never route a runtime string through them.
