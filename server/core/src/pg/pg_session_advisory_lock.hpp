/// @file pg_session_advisory_lock.hpp
/// Generic exception-safe RAII release for a SESSION-scoped Postgres
/// advisory lock — lifted out of `kek_op_lock.hpp`'s `KekOpLockGuard` (#2395,
/// governance-hardened) so a second store that needs a session-scoped lock
/// does not hand-roll its own release protocol.
///
/// THE MECHANISM (what every consumer needs to know): a session advisory
/// lock is released by an explicit `pg_advisory_unlock` call — an ORDINARY
/// SQL statement, so it fails at the QUERY level on a connection whose
/// transaction is currently ABORTED, rather than actually releasing the
/// lock. Left there, the lock survives whatever ROLLBACK eventually
/// happens, the connection itself stays `CONNECTION_OK`, and
/// `PgPool::release()` (which only checks `PQstatus`) recycles a connection
/// still holding it. Session advisory locks are re-entrant per backend, so
/// the wedge is asymmetric: whichever request next draws the poisoned
/// connection succeeds while every other connection is denied indefinitely.
///
/// THE RECOVERY PROTOCOL this guard's destructor runs on an unlock-query
/// failure: (1) if the connection is already dead, nothing leaked — the
/// session, and every lock it held, is gone with it. (2) If the connection
/// is alive and its transaction is ABORTED (the ordinary case above),
/// ROLLBACK (the one statement Postgres accepts in that state) and retry
/// the SAME targeted unlock once — this recovers the ordinary case
/// genuinely, not merely best-effort. (3) Only if that does not apply, or
/// does not work, does it fall back to terminating this backend
/// (`pg_terminate_backend(pg_backend_pid())`) as a LAST resort — itself an
/// ordinary SQL statement with no special exemption from the same failure
/// mode, so this is best-effort, not a hard guarantee, for whatever is left
/// after (1) and (2) do not apply.
///
/// HISTORY (condensed; see #2964 PR history for the full account): an
/// earlier revision hand-rolled its own release with a false claim that
/// `pg_advisory_unlock_all()` was a working "fallback" (it fails
/// identically to the targeted unlock in the aborted-transaction case);
/// a later revision fixed that but then fell straight to
/// `pg_terminate_backend` on any live-connection failure with an
/// overclaimed "correct by construction" comment — also false, since that
/// terminate call fails the same way on an aborted transaction. THIS
/// revision is the first to actually recover the aborted-transaction case
/// (step (2) above) rather than merely documenting around it. The T12
/// rotation-sweep call site (`api_token_store.cpp`) is additionally safe
/// against this specific failure mode by an UNRELATED, unpinned mechanism —
/// its unlock guard is declared before the `pg::PgTxn` covering its
/// classification transaction, so reverse-destruction-order means
/// `~PgTxn`'s own ROLLBACK always runs first — but that is a property of
/// THAT call site's declaration order, not of this guard, and a THIRD
/// consumer must not assume it gets that property for free.

/// A SESSION advisory lock's KEY, as the Postgres SQL expression(s) that
/// compute it — generates matching try-lock/unlock SQL from ONE definition
/// (#2964 round 3 review finding 3), so a call site can never hand-write a
/// try-lock and an unlock statement that reference different keys. Before
/// this existed, each of the two consumers (`KekOpLockGuard`,
/// `api_token_store.cpp`'s rotation-sweep lock) hand-wrote its own matched
/// pair of SQL string constants; a drift between them unlocks a key this
/// session never locked, Postgres returns `false` (a legitimate result for
/// "not held"), and the guard's destructor treats that as released — a
/// SILENT leak of the key actually held, indistinguishable from the benign
/// release-if-held case.
///
/// Two forms, matching the two this codebase's session locks use today:
///   * `single(key_sql)` — one bigint key expression, e.g.
///     `"hashtextextended('api_token_store:rotation_sweep', 0)"`.
///   * `pair(classid_sql, objid_sql)` — two int32 key expressions, e.g.
///     `"2037545589"` and `"hashtext('secrets_kek_op')"`.
///
/// Each argument is a full SQL EXPRESSION, not a literal value — every
/// existing call site's key is (at least in part) computed by Postgres
/// itself (`hashtext`/`hashtextextended`), never reproduced in C++, so this
/// stores the expression text rather than a resolved integer.
