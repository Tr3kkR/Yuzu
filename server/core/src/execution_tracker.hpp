///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): AUTHORITATIVE/fail-hard construction — a
/// reachable database whose schema can't migrate/open is a fatal startup
/// error (`startup_failed_`), a posture UPGRADE from the SQLite era, where
/// migration failure set `migration_ok_ = false` but `server.cpp` never
/// checked it (the shared `InstructionDbPool`'s own `is_open()` was the
/// only thing `/readyz` keyed on). Runtime reads/writes keep their
/// pre-migration plain-container/`std::expected<std::string,std::string>`
/// shapes — this store's consumers (gRPC `AgentServiceImpl`, REST v1,
/// legacy REST, MCP, dashboard, `ScheduleRunner`) are unaffected by this
/// migration.
///
/// Backfill: NONE (ADR-0009's 2026-08-25 fresh-start-by-default amendment).
/// The legacy `instructions.db` (shared with the ScheduleEngine/
/// ApprovalManager siblings, both already migrated — ADR-0065) is never
/// read for data; construction logs a one-time "fresh start, no legacy
/// backfill" line, and the caller (`server.cpp`) runs
/// `legacy_sqlite_probe::warn_if_legacy_rows()` over the legacy file so an
/// environment where "no production fleet" turns out to be locally wrong
/// gets a loud signal instead of silent loss. This is the LAST of the 7
/// Wave-4 SQLite components — `InstructionDbPool` is deleted once this
