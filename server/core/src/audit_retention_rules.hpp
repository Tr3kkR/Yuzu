/// function.
///
/// Split out of `AuditStore` deliberately, following the convention the other
/// server stores use for exactly this problem (`preflight_parse.hpp`,
/// `deployment_parse.hpp`, `network_perf_rules.hpp`, `compliance_eval.hpp`): a
/// pure decision function lives in its own header so it can be pinned by a
/// table test with no database, no clock and no fixture, WITHOUT widening the
/// store's public class surface. No sibling store exposes a public static, and
/// `AuditStore` should not be the first.
///
/// Why it is worth isolating: the retention guard's precedence went unpinned
/// long enough for two separate mutations to survive, because reaching it meant
/// standing up a seeded multi-pass integration test. As a free function it is
/// five bools in, one enum out.

/// than decorative. `prev_unusable` has three carriers and only two of them
/// disengage the previous reading; the load-time flag does not, and is not
/// consumed on a probe-failure pass. Corrupt stored meta, then a probe failure,
/// then a pass eight days later arrives with both facts true. (An earlier
/// version of this comment claimed the edge was unreachable, while the truth
/// table in the sibling test pinned that exact combination.)

/// nothing to hold back, and the only thing still worth reporting is an unusable

/// Before it existed, a pass with no comparison point rested entirely on the
/// outcome test, so a host already skewed FORWARD -- whose post-skew rows are
/// still inside the window, defeating `would_wipe` -- deleted with every
/// detector false. Sitting last, it cannot mask a more specific verdict: a wipe
/// or a step still reports as itself, and it only speaks when nothing else did.
/// Sitting AFTER `!has_expired` is what keeps it quiet on the case that made
/// this a judgement call at all -- a fresh install has no anchor and nothing to
/// delete, so it never declines, and the trigger costs an operator nothing until
/// there is actually data at risk.
///
/// It needs no anti-latch special case, unlike the parallel implementation that
/// carried this trigger on another line: deduplication compares the whole fact
/// SET, so the next pass -- which has re-anchored, and therefore differs in this
/// very field -- is a different set and reports on its own merits.
