/// @file app_usage_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres per-agent last-used app-usage store (wave 7 PR7.2, schema
/// `app_usage_store`): the projection for the `app_usage` daily-sync source
/// (ADR-0016 §5) — per-executable first/last-seen and a trailing-30-day
/// run_count/total_seconds window, derived on the agent from TAR's
/// `usage_daily` fold via the read-only `app_usage` plugin.
///
/// RETAINED-WINDOW SEMANTICS (adjudication P3, binding — every doc, comment
/// and user-facing string for this store and its callers must say this
/// honestly): `first_seen`/`last_seen` on `agent_last_used` are NOT values
/// spanning the executable's full run history. The agent computes them as
/// MIN/MAX over the `usage_daily` rows
/// still inside TAR's `usage` retention window (`tar_schema_registry.cpp`,
/// `daily` suffix, `retention_default = 2678400` — 31 days by default,
/// operator-tunable). An executable absent from a blob has not run inside
/// that retained window; it does not mean the executable has never run. This
/// store persists exactly what the agent reports — it never reconstructs a
/// longer history — so the wording above applies to every read this store
/// serves. A durable, retention-independent full-history aggregate is out of
/// scope for this store (deferred, def-4).
///
/// HASH-SKIP OVER RAW BYTES (mirrors `SoftwareLicensingStore`, ADR-0024
/// Decision 3 / roadmap D-2): `content_hash` is the SHA-256 of the RAW
/// received blob bytes, recomputed by the ingest seam
/// (`app_usage_ingestion.cpp`) — never re-derived from parsed rows and never
/// trusted from the agent's claim. The store has no canonical_hash of its
/// own: it persists the seam's hash verbatim and offers the trichotomy
/// primitives (`stored_hash` / `touch` / `replace_agent_last_used`) the seam
/// drives — stored (full payload replaced), touched (hash matched, freshness
/// bumped), need-full (no state row or drifted hash).
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement,
/// uses `RETURNING`, bounded leases (`pool_.try_acquire_for` on every
/// runtime method). Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1):
///   - **Ingest:** fail-soft — a transient PG outage returns false; the seam
///     nacks and the agent re-sends next cycle.
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — a store/pool/query failure returns
///     `std::nullopt`, NEVER a silent empty. An empty *value* = a genuine
///     zero-row result.
///   - `first_seen`/`last_seen`/`updated_at` on the state row are SERVER
///     receipt time (TIMESTAMPTZ, `now()` in SQL — never the agent-supplied
///     collection time; the #1685 lesson / ADR-0016 clock-skew rule). The
///     per-row `first_seen`/`last_seen`/`run_count_30d`/`total_seconds_30d`
///     columns on `agent_last_used` ARE the agent-observed, retained-window
///     values (they are the payload, not a freshness stamp).
///
/// DECOMMISSION (PLAN-01 ruling (b), Alex 2026-09-06): `delete_agent` erases
/// the agent from BOTH `usage_state` and `agent_last_used` in ONE transaction.
/// This is load-bearing, not tidiness: `usage_state.content_hash` drives the
/// hash-skip trichotomy, so a delete that cleared `agent_last_used` but left
/// `usage_state` would make the still-enrolled agent's next sync `touched`
/// and the projection would NEVER repopulate (rest-api.md:5089 documents that
/// erasure does not unenroll). Pinned by test: after delete_agent,
/// `stored_hash(agent)` is nullopt AND `get_agent_last_used(agent)` is an
/// empty vector (not nullopt).
///
/// Registered in the agent-decommission cascade (agent_decommission.hpp,
/// AgentDecommissionStores::app_usage, the sixth and last store) — the
/// DELETE /api/v1/sle/agents/{id} route erases this store under the scoped
/// `Decommission:Delete` securable (ADR-0024 Decision 9 as amended). This
/// header provides the honest two-table `delete_agent` the cascade calls;
/// see agent_decommission.cpp's registration list for the wiring.
