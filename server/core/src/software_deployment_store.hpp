/// @file software_deployment_store.hpp
/// Migrated Postgres store (ADR-0006, schema `software_deployment_store`,
/// ADR-0051) for capability 7.6 — a lightweight software packaging + fleet
/// deployment catalog: `SoftwarePackage` installers, `SoftwareDeployment`
/// lifecycle jobs against a scope expression, and per-agent
/// `AgentDeploymentStatus` install outcomes.
///
/// **DORMANT** (verified 2026-08-14 against origin/dev): nothing in
/// production constructs this store — `rest_api_v1.hpp`'s `sw_deploy_store`
/// parameter defaults to `nullptr` and no call site passes a non-null one
/// (`acc6c481a` wired construction, `2fcfb95b5`'s server.cpp decomposition
/// removed it — an operator decision to shelve the capability, not an
/// accidental regression; same family as `LicenseStore`, ADR-0048). The
/// `/api/v1/software-packages*` / `/api/v1/software-deployments*` routes in
/// `rest_api_v1.cpp` are compiled and register whenever a non-null pointer
/// IS passed, so this header's contract is real even though nothing
/// exercises it in production today. See ADR-0051 for the full
/// posture/backfill/dormancy record.
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard, both construction and
/// runtime — same reasoning as `DeploymentStore` (ADR-0043): no in-memory
/// authoritative layer sits above this data, so every reader/mutator returns
/// `std::expected<..., std::string>` and a genuine DB/lease failure is never
/// papered over as an empty/false/not-found result. Every such failure is
/// prefixed `kSwDeployDbErrorPrefix` ("db_error: "), mirroring
/// `DeploymentStore`/`AccessReviewStore` — a machine-checkable idiom so a
/// route handler can classify 503 (store outage) vs 400/404
/// (validation/business rule) without pattern-matching message text.
///
/// Three tables with INTERNAL foreign keys (no external coupling):
/// `software_packages` (parent) -> `software_deployments` (`package_id` FK)
/// -> `agent_software_status` (`deployment_id` FK, PK
/// `(deployment_id, agent_id)`). **Postgres ENFORCES these FKs** — the
/// pre-migration SQLite store never ran `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`, so an
/// orphan row (a deployment referencing a deleted package, e.g.) was
/// possible there and is not here. See the `.cpp`'s `migrate_from_sqlite`
/// doc comment for how backfill handles a legacy orphan (fails the whole
/// backfill closed — there is no valid parent to satisfy the FK with) and
/// `delete_package`'s doc comment for the enforced-FK behavior change on the
/// live path.
///
/// `id` (packages, deployments) stays a client-generated 32-hex-char TEXT
/// surrogate key — the pre-migration `generate_id()` format (two
/// `mt19937_64` 64-bit draws formatted as 16 hex chars each), unchanged
/// (playbook: keep pre-migration ID contracts). `agent_software_status` has
/// no surrogate id — its PK is the natural `(deployment_id, agent_id)` pair,
/// also unchanged.
