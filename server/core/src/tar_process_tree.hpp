/// @file tar_process_tree.hpp
/// The TAR process-tree viewer's PURE reconstruction engine (no DB, no HTTP — so
/// it is unit-testable directly with synthetic rows). The route module
/// (tar_tree_routes.cpp) dispatches a canned, read-only `tar.sql` to ONE live host
/// (the device-page "Get live info" dispatch/poll seam), feeds the pipe-delimited
/// output through the parsers here, reconstructs a per-host process tree over a
/// chosen window, flags anomalies, and renders the HTMX fragments.
///
/// Data source is the agent's LOCAL tar.db ONLY (via `tar.sql` over `$Process_Live`
/// + `$TCP_Live`) — no live process probe, no server-side mirror, no agent seed.
/// Consequences baked into the model:
///   * Windows process rows are ETW names-only → `cmdline` is empty and there is
///     no executable path. We surface that honestly; we do NOT enrich.
///   * There are no start/exit-time columns — a process's lifetime is derived from
///     its `started`/`stopped` event timestamps in `$Process_Live`.
///   * `$Process_Live` is row-capped (100k, no seed): a long-running process whose
///     `started` event aged out can only be partially reconstructed (we synthesise
///     a "started before observation" incarnation from its `stopped` row when one
///     survives; if neither survives it cannot appear).
///   * The agent forbids recursive CTEs, so the tree is built HERE in C++ from flat
///     rows, never in SQL.
