/// @file authz_topology_floor.hpp
/// The ONE place the "topology floor" set is decided (#2376).
///
/// THE DEFECT: `RbacStore::rbac_enabled_` defaults FALSE (a fresh install runs
/// with RBAC off), and with RBAC off `AuthRoutes::require_permission` /
/// `require_scoped_permission` fall through to the legacy branch, which
/// allows every `Read` to any authenticated non-engine session. On a default
/// install that hands a plain `user` fleet-wide read of the authorization
/// TOPOLOGY itself — the access-review export (SOC 2 CC6.2 evidence), the
/// RBAC role graph (`/api/v1/rbac/roles`), and the engine-principal grant
/// graph.
///
/// THE RULE: the reads named below require admin REGARDLESS of the RBAC
/// on/off toggle. This floor is applied ONLY inside the legacy (RBAC-off)
/// fallback of `require_permission`/`require_scoped_permission` — it never
/// overrides a live RBAC grant. That ordering matters: #2324 cut a dedicated
/// `AccessReview` securable specifically so a non-admin `Reviewer` role could
/// be seeded with `AccessReview:Read`; if this floor ran ahead of (or
/// instead of) the live-RBAC branch it would deny that seeded role and
/// destroy the whole reason the securable exists. The floor exists to close
/// the RBAC-OFF gap only.
///
/// The floor is deliberately NOT configurable — a toggle that can re-open a
/// security floor is a footgun, not a feature.
///
/// `Security:Read` was considered and deliberately EXCLUDED: it is too
/// coarse for this purpose — it also gates quarantine visibility, CA
/// issued-certs, `/ca/root-csr`, and KEK status, which are operational reads,
/// not authorization topology. `ApiToken:Read` and `ManagementGroup:Read`
/// were likewise considered and excluded for the same reason.
///
/// #4028 (api-parity programme #2146) extended the floor's ORIGINAL
/// "authorization topology" framing above to a second, related case: the
/// eight Settings read-twins (`GET /api/v1/settings/*` +
/// `GET /api/v2/agent/plugin-policy` — its deprecated `/v1/` predecessor
/// stayed on `require_admin`, #4144) were previously gated by
/// `AuthRoutes::require_admin` — a whole-route role check with no RBAC-off
/// fallback at all. Migrating them onto RBAC securables
/// (`TlsConfig`/`PluginSigning`/`ServerConfig`/`AnalyticsConfig`, all
/// `Read`) without also flooring them here would silently WIDEN every one
/// of them from admin-only to any-authenticated-user on the RBAC-off
/// default install — the exact defect class this file exists to close, even
/// though TLS/plugin-signing config isn't "authorization topology" in the
/// narrow sense the paragraph above describes. Any future route that
/// migrates an admin-only gate onto a new Read securable should apply the
/// same reasoning: the floor exists to preserve an EXISTING admin-only
/// posture across the RBAC-off toggle, not only to protect the RBAC graph
/// itself.
///
/// EXTEND this set, never fork it — a second copy of a floor set is exactly
/// the kind of drift the repo's other chokepoints (`dispatch_confined_arms.hpp`,
/// `principal_quota_gate.hpp`) exist to prevent.
