/// /network fleet read model — PURE aggregation over per-device current
/// heartbeat NETWORK facts, joined with the device's perf sample and a
/// server-resolved app-instability flag. Computed at request time over
/// registry/store state — ZERO new storage. Validation and percentile ranking
/// come from network_perf_rules.hpp (which reuses dex_perf_rules.hpp), shared
/// with the Prometheus rollup so the cards and the gauges can never disagree.
///
/// THE EDGE SHIPS FACTS; this model COUNTS co-occurrence (network ∩ device ∩
/// app) but NEVER attributes a cause. The causal verdict ("it's the network")
/// is a deliberate post-v1 OVERLAY — a contained deterministic rule for
/// automation + an agentic colleague for deep-dive. Nothing here blames.
///
/// Honesty rules: a metric nobody reported is ABSENT (std::nullopt), never 0;
/// every aggregate carries its reporting population; RTT carries its OWN
/// denominator (devices that report smoothed RTT — fewer than the total today,
/// because Windows RTT is coarser/absent pending the ESTATS-vs-ETW spike), so
/// an RTT average over Linux devices is never presented as fleet-wide truth.
