/// which must not serve the plaintext an older writer recorded in a row's `detail`.
/// Routing that through `runtime_config_store.hpp` made the evidence substrate
/// depend on a specific domain store (and, transitively, on nlohmann) to reach two
/// static members. Both now depend on this instead, and on nothing else.

/// a core-language fact, so it holds on every supported toolchain.
/// DO NOT respell this to a common word. `is_redaction_placeholder()` refuses any
/// value CONTAINING this token, which is safe only because `<redacted>` is implausible
/// as a substring of a real credential (`<` and `>` are outside the alphabet of every

/// newline through the guard and be stored AS the client secret, destroying the real
/// one - the exact outcome the guard exists to prevent. It lives here, and is called

/// back from the startup log - the only surface that emits it. `GET /api/config` omits
/// a secret's value entirely rather than substituting a placeholder, precisely so a
/// round-tripping client cannot write one back. (The Settings form renders the
/// field with `value=""` unconditionally, so it never pre-fills the literal - only the
/// greyed placeholder ATTRIBUTE varies, and an attribute is never submitted.) Using
/// the CONTAINS predicate there meant a
/// real secret that happened to contain the token was silently discarded and reported
/// SAVED - the same false-success this whole change exists to remove. Containment now
/// falls through to the sink, which refuses it with a message the operator sees.
