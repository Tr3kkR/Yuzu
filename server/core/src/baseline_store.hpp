/// @file baseline_store.hpp
/// Server-side storage for Guardian **Baselines** — the named, deployable
/// collection of Guards. See docs/guardian-baseline-model.md (resolved model)
/// and docs/guardian-mvp-contract.md §6/§7 (frozen contract; G10's single-scope
/// targeting is superseded by the baseline-model doc — assignment is now
/// included − excluded management groups).
///
/// Migrated to PostgreSQL (ADR-0006/0008/0009/0055, schema `baseline_store`);
/// was `guardian-baselines.db` (SQLite). See
/// docs/adr/0055-baseline-store-postgres-migration.md for the migration's
/// posture decisions (this header follows that ADR verbatim) and
/// docs/yuzu-guardian-design-v1.1.md §9.1/§24 for the schema + standing
/// invariants.
///
/// Model recap (what this store persists):
///   - A Baseline groups one or more Guards (M:N, via `baseline_rules`) and
///     carries an ASSIGNMENT: a set of *included* minus *excluded* management
///     groups (`baseline_groups`; exclude wins, whole-Baseline grain).
///   - The Baseline is the ONLY deployable unit — individual Guards are never
///     deployed on their own (same shape as a GPO / Intune baseline / Jamf
///     Configuration Profile). Deploy is a separate, later slice; this store is
///     pure control-plane config with no engine dependency.
///   - Lifecycle is draft ↔ deployed (MVP). `deployed_snapshot` holds the member
///     set captured at the last deploy and is the ENFORCED set — the push/reconcile
///     gate reads it via deployed_member_rule_ids(), and the detail renderer diffs
///     it against live members for the "re-deploy to apply" flag.
///
/// Cross-store references (deliberate, no in-DB foreign key):
///   - A member row's `rule_id` points at a Guard in `GuaranteedStateStore`
///     (a DIFFERENT Postgres schema), and an assignment row's `group_id` points
///     at a management group in `ManagementGroupStore` (also a different
///     schema) — a cross-schema `REFERENCES` foreign key is possible in
///     Postgres but deliberately NOT used here, matching the pre-migration
///     SQLite store's cross-*file* reasoning: a membership/assignment row
///     whose target Guard or group has since been deleted is HARMLESS at
///     deploy time (the push builder resolves member Guards from the Guard
///     store and simply skips one that no longer exists). For config
///     integrity we still expose application-level cleanup hooks —
///     remove_rule_everywhere() / remove_group_everywhere() — for the
///     Guard-delete and group-delete paths to call in a later slice.
///   - The join tables DO carry an in-schema foreign key to `baselines` (same
///     schema) with ON DELETE CASCADE, so delete_baseline() tears down its own
///     members + assignment atomically, and inserting a join row for a
///     non-existent baseline is rejected by the FK.
///
/// Unlike the Guard EVENT store this is bounded operator-authored config (not a
/// multi-GB/day stream), so there is deliberately NO retention reaper / cleanup
/// thread here.
///
/// ── Posture (ADR-0012 §1 / ADR-0055) ─────────────────────────────────────────
/// Every table is operator-authored Guardian enforcement config — uniformly
/// AUTHORITATIVE (unlike ADR-0038's split-by-table-family, there is no
/// bounded/re-derivable telemetry table here to carve out a fail-soft tier).
///  - **Baseline CRUD writes — fail-hard** (unchanged from pre-migration):
///    `create_baseline`/`update_baseline`/`delete_baseline`/`set_members`/
///    `set_assignment` stay `std::expected<..., std::string>`, a
///    `kConflictPrefix`-tagged error mapping to HTTP 409.
///  - **The catastrophic-read set (CLAUDE.md Guardian invariant)** —
///    `deployed_member_rule_ids()` (both overloads) feed the push fan-out /
///    heartbeat reconcile gate and the per-device compliance REST view, so
///    BOTH are now `std::expected<..., std::string>`: a degraded read
///    (store-not-open / lease-timeout / query-error) is `std::unexpected`,
///    NEVER a silent empty container indistinguishable from "nothing
///    deployed" — every push/reconcile/REST consumer MUST abort (503 / no-op
///    push) on `!result`. A malformed OR genuinely-empty stored
///    `deployed_snapshot` is **not** a degrade — it is a successful read that
///    contributes nothing to the union (unchanged, fail-closed-by-construction
///    behavior pinned by the pre-migration store's own doc comment).
///  - **`get_members_checked()`** is a degrade-distinguishable twin of the
///    plain `get_members()` for the ONE call site that writes a live-member
///    read into a DURABLE enforced snapshot (the deploy handler,
///    `guardian_routes.cpp`) — a lease timeout there must abort the deploy,
///    never persist `deployed_snapshot = "[]"` (a durable disarm). Every other
///    `get_members()` caller is render-only / deny-or-benign (dashboard
///    fragments, the "drifted from deployed" diff) and keeps the plain
///    empty-on-degrade container (ADR-0038 "deferred widening" class).
///  - Every other read (`list_baselines`/`get_assignment`/`baselines_containing_rule`/
///    counts) stays plain container/size_t, empty-on-degrade — dashboard
///    display only, never an enforce/target decision.
