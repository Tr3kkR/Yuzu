/// @file product_pack_store.hpp
/// Migrated Postgres store (ADR-0006/0009/0054, schema `product_pack_store`) for operator-
/// installed product packs — multi-document YAML bundles that install into the
/// `InstructionStore`/`PolicyStore`/`WorkflowEngine` catalogs via a caller-supplied
/// `ItemInstallFn`/`ItemUninstallFn`. Two tables, one real internal FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
/// (`product_pack_items.pack_id -> product_packs.id`), ported unchanged.
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard, both construction and runtime — packs are
/// operator-installed content (build-time-seeded packs plus operator additions), not a cache.
/// `install`/`uninstall` already returned `std::expected` pre-migration; `list`/`get` are widened
/// to `std::expected` here (ADR-0036 typed-read policy) so a genuine DB error is never collapsed
/// into "no packs installed" / "not found" — matching `LicenseStore`/`ResultSetStore`'s `get`
/// shape (`std::expected<std::optional<T>, std::string>`).
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008): the store holds a `pg::PgPool&` (not a `sqlite3*`), runs its
/// schema migration at construction on a pinned lease, and schema-qualifies every runtime
/// statement (`product_pack_store.product_packs` / `product_pack_store.product_pack_items`) —
/// pooled connections carry no per-store search_path. Mutate-and-return uses `RETURNING` where a
/// caller needs to distinguish "inserted" from "conflicted", never `sqlite3_changes()`.
///
/// **`install()` no longer holds a `pool_` lease across the `ItemInstallFn` callback loop.**
/// The pre-migration SQLite version wrapped the whole install (metadata insert + per-document
/// `install_fn` calls into `InstructionStore`/`PolicyStore`/`WorkflowEngine`) inside one
/// `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on `db_`. Under the Postgres substrate that shape is forbidden
/// (`docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`: "never call another store while holding a lease" — those
/// sibling stores draw from the SAME shared `PgPool`, so holding our own lease while they try to
/// acquire theirs risks starving a saturated pool). This was never a genuine cross-store
/// transaction even pre-migration: `install_fn`'s callees write to THEIR OWN `db_`/pool, never
/// ours. The new shape preserves that same atomicity boundary explicitly: `install_fn` is called
/// with no lease of ours held; once every document has been resolved, the pack row + its
/// successfully-installed item rows are written in ONE `pool_` transaction (parent-before-child,
/// satisfying the FK). A total-failure install (zero items installed) never WRITES to Postgres —
/// gov Gate 3 (cpp-expert, #3481): a keyed install's F033 idempotency pre-check runs one
/// read-only `SELECT` before `install_fn` is ever reached, so "never touches Postgres at all"
/// stopped being literally true once that pre-check landed.
///
/// **Update (F031/#3481, 2026-08-24): a late failure of that final persist transaction — AFTER
/// `install_fn` already committed one or more documents into sibling stores — is no longer a
/// silent orphan.** `install()` now accepts `compensate_fn` (see its doc comment below) and, on
/// that failure, walks every already-installed item in REVERSE install order, calling
/// `compensate_fn(kind, item_id)` on each as a best-effort undo. Reverse order matters: a bundle
/// can install a `PolicyFragment` followed by a `Policy` that references it (bundle order is
/// dependency order — `PolicyStore::create_policy` validates the fragment exists at creation
/// time), and `PolicyStore::delete_fragment` refuses while any `Policy` still references it —
/// compensating forward would spuriously fail to clean up the fragment. **This safety argument
/// is `PolicyStore`-specific and holds only when the bundle itself respects dependency order**
/// (gov Gate 5 CHAOS-4) — `WorkflowEngine::create_workflow` performs NO existence check on the
/// `InstructionDefinition` ids its steps reference at creation time, so a bundle placing a
/// `Workflow` document BEFORE the `InstructionDefinition` it references produces a brief window,
/// scoped to the remaining length of the SAME compensation loop, where the `Workflow` row (not
/// yet reached by the reverse walk) points at an already-compensated `InstructionDefinition` —
/// self-heals when the loop reaches it moments later, but is a real, undocumented-until-now gap
/// in the "reverse order is always safe" framing. This is best-effort, not
/// a guarantee: a sibling store's own delete can itself fail for a reason unrelated to ordering
/// (a `PolicyFragment` referenced by some OTHER, unrelated policy is the same tolerated exception
/// documented for `uninstall()` below) — a residual orphan from a failed compensation is logged
/// at `spdlog::error` (naming the exact kind/item id) and counted in
/// `yuzu_server_product_pack_install_compensation_total{result}`, for operator follow-up, not
/// automatically retried.
///
/// **Gate 6 review (#3481, sre): the metric/log/audit trail for a compensation attempt is
/// written only after the reverse-order loop completes** — a process crash or forced restart
/// DURING the loop (including immediately after its last, successful iteration but before the
/// trailing emit) leaves that install attempt with NO metric sample, NO summary log line, and
/// NO audit row at all — the request handler never resumes to call `audit_fn`. This is not a
/// regression versus pre-#3481 behavior (every late failure silently orphaned content
/// unconditionally, with the same absent observability) — it degrades to exactly the bug F031
/// exists to close, in the rare window a crash coincides with an already-rare late-install
/// failure. Operator guidance: a restart around the time of a large pack install, with no
/// matching `YuzuProductPackCompensationPartial` alert or `spdlog::error` line for that attempt,
/// is not proof compensation ran cleanly — check the submitted bundle against sibling-store
/// content manually in that specific window. Not closed here; a fast-follow could increment the
/// metric at the FIRST failed item rather than after the loop (never pre-increment — Prometheus
/// counters can't decrement, so a pre-increment-then-correct pattern would false-alarm on every
/// clean compensation), but that changes exactly the emission-point semantics Gate 8 verified
/// with `promtool test rules` and would need its own re-verification, not a casual patch.
///
/// **No `mtx_` (the pre-migration `shared_mutex` is dropped).** Postgres's MVCC + the pool's own
/// connection-level concurrency replace the SQLite single-writer mutex, matching every other
/// migrated store on the ladder. This is a deliberate, accepted trade: two concurrent
/// `uninstall(id, ...)` calls for the SAME id can both pass the `get(id)` existence check and
/// both invoke `uninstall_fn` on the sibling stores before either's delete transaction runs —
/// the sibling-store uninstalls are themselves idempotent-ish (a missing item is just a `false`
/// return, logged, not fatal) and the final Postgres delete is a plain `DELETE ... WHERE id=$1`
/// (harmless if the row is already gone). A small race window, not a security boundary —
/// `ResultSetStore`'s per-owner quota/pin-limit soft-enforcement is the ladder's precedent for
/// recording this class of trade explicitly rather than silently.
///
/// **Update (F032/#3481, 2026-08-24): `uninstall()`'s final metadata-delete transaction can
/// likewise fail AFTER `uninstall_fn` has already removed the real sibling-store content** — the
/// pack stays listed as installed, pointing at content that no longer exists. Unlike F031 above,
/// this gap is accepted as a store-scoped residual risk rather than closed, because there is no
/// symmetric fix: the sibling content is already gone, and re-creating deleted content to satisfy
/// a rollback would itself be a hazard (resurrecting content an operator explicitly asked to
/// remove, from no fresh operator input). Accepted on two grounds: (1) a plain client retry
/// self-heals it — re-issuing the DELETE re-runs `uninstall_fn` against items that are already
/// gone (idempotent no-ops for every sibling store's delete-by-id), then the metadata-delete
/// transaction runs again and, absent a repeat failure, succeeds; (2) the blast radius is the same
/// operator-authored-catalog-metadata classification ADR-0009's `ProductPackStore`/ADR-0054 update
/// note already applies to this store, not personal or regulated subject/device data. **What this
/// does NOT close:** between the failure and a successful retry, `get()`/`list()` show a pack
/// pointing at deleted content, and a lookup that follows one of its item ids into another
/// endpoint 404s — expected during that window, not a new fault, but genuinely visible to a caller
/// that doesn't retry. This reasoning is store-scoped and MUST be re-derived, not copied, by any
/// future store whose own uninstall path can leave metadata dangling over content that cannot be
/// safely restored.
///
/// No secrets (ADR-0010 N/A): `yaml_source` is pack content — verified against
/// `docs/Instruction-Engine.md` / `docs/yaml-dsl-spec.md`, neither of which defines a
/// secret-typed/credential-bearing YAML field; the only crypto-adjacent fields are the public
/// `signature`/`publicKey` pair, which are not secret material. Free-text columns
/// (`name`/`description`/`yaml_source` and the item equivalents) are still `sanitize_pg_text`'d
/// before every write — libpq's text-format binding is C-string-based, so an embedded NUL byte
/// would otherwise silently TRUNCATE the stored value at that point (worse than the
/// pre-migration `sqlite3_bind_text(..., -1, ...)`, which had the identical truncation behavior
/// — U+FFFD replacement is a strict improvement, not a new risk). Sanitization is at-rest
/// storage hygiene only; it does not re-verify the Ed25519 signature over the sanitized bytes —
/// `verify_signature` runs once, before sanitization, over the exact bytes that were signed.
