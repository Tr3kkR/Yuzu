/// @file inventory_store.hpp
/// Generic per-source inventory blob store (Issue 7.17) — born on SQLite,
/// migrated to Postgres (ADR-0006/0008/0009/0037, schema `inventory_store`).
/// The sync-framework's generic `(agent_id, plugin) -> data_json` home for
/// every source that has NOT been promoted to its own typed projection; it
/// backs the scope-walking `kInventoryQuery` source + the inventory eval
/// engine (`inventory_eval.hpp`).
///
/// COEXISTS with `SoftwareInventoryStore` (ADR-0016, schema
/// `software_inventory_store`) — this is NOT that store's migration. The
/// typed sources (`installed_software`, `app_perf`, `device_ci`,
/// `software_licensing`) are skipped by the generic gateway/direct ingest
/// loop (`is_typed_inventory_source`) precisely so their rows never land
/// here; every OTHER plugin's blob still lands in this store. See
/// `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md` and ADR-0037.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement
/// (`inventory_store.inventory_data`). Mutators check the `PgResult` status
/// directly rather than `sqlite3_changes()` (#1033); none needs `RETURNING`
/// (no caller consumes an affected-row count). Generic plugins must not emit
/// credentials or secret material: `data_json` is stored as plaintext and its
/// sensitivity is otherwise plugin-dependent (ADR-0010).
///
/// Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1), split by operation class:
///  - **Ingest (`upsert`)**: FAIL-SOFT. A transient lease/query failure logs
///    a warning and returns — never throws, never blocks the gRPC/gateway
///    ingest thread. The next changed/full report re-sends the same blob
///    (bounded by the weekly full floor), so a dropped write self-heals
///    (mirrors `SoftwareInventoryStore`'s ingest posture).
///  - **Reads (`list_tables`, `get`, `query`, `get_agent_inventory`,
///    `count`)**: AUTHORITATIVE. A store/pool/query failure is reported as a
///    degrade — `std::nullopt` for the list/count reads, `std::unexpected(
///    InventoryReadError::kDegraded)` for the single-record `get` — NEVER a
///    silent empty. An empty *value* is a genuine zero-row result; a degrade
///    means the store could not be read at all. Callers MUST surface a
///    degrade (503 / banner), never `.value_or({})` it into a silent empty —
///    that re-opens the fail-open hole ADR-0016 §7 / the playbook's
///    anti-patterns list forbid.
///  - **`delete_agent`**: erases PostgreSQL rows for the agent. Returns false
///    if the delete does not commit, so the decommission cascade can retry.
///
/// `migrate_from_sqlite()` retired (#3623, ADR-0037 Update): no production fleet ever ran a
/// pre-Postgres build of this store, so the one-time first-boot backfill it implemented never
/// had real legacy data to protect. `server.cpp` now runs
/// `legacy_sqlite_probe::warn_if_legacy_rows` over `inventory_data` instead — silent unless
/// real rows are found, never blocks boot. `delete_agent` no longer erases anything from a
/// legacy `inventory.db`: a leftover legacy file is never read and never scrubbed by this
/// store — see `docs/user-manual/upgrading.md`'s InventoryStore section for the operator note.
