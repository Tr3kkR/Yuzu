///
/// The SERVER-WIDE OTA transfer gate (#913's fleet-wide half): the in-flight
/// counter, the two-ceiling reserve arithmetic, and the RAII slot that releases
/// it, as one testable unit.
///
/// WHY IT IS SEPARATE, and this is the whole reason the file exists. While the
/// counter lived inline in the handler, NOTHING OBSERVED IT. Every live-wire
/// case could only reach the gate one call at a time — `max_concurrent_total=0`
/// rejects with the counter untouched (`prev = 0 >= 0`), and a cap of 1 driven
/// sequentially admits with the counter untouched (`prev` is 0 every time) — so
/// deleting the `fetch_add` outright left the entire `[ota]` suite green. A gate
/// whose central mechanism can be removed without a red test is not a tested
/// gate, and a live `DownloadUpdate` cannot be held mid-transfer from a unit
/// test without a package on disk and a peer that stalls.
///
/// So OCCUPANCY is tested here, directly and deterministically: acquire, hold,
/// watch the next acquire refuse, release, watch it admit again. No threads, no
/// timing. `test_ota_download_bound.cpp` still proves the gate is WIRED into the
/// real handler over the real wire; this proves it COUNTS.
