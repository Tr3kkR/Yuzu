/// @file device_api.hpp
/// The FOURTH per-family in-process API seam for the presentation/core/engine
/// split (ADR-0031, WS-A4, family=`device`), copying the merged
/// `network_api.hpp`/`verify_api.hpp`/`compliance_api.hpp` templates
/// verbatim in shape. Abstract, ZERO store-shaped dependencies — only std
/// headers, so this header can be included by a future presentation-side
/// client without dragging the server's `AgentRegistry`/`TagStore` layer
/// along.
///
/// The method set == the public REST resources it stands in front of, 1:1
/// (INV-31-4 "no private core API"):
///   - `list_devices`   <-> `GET /api/v1/devices`      (MCP `list_agents`)
///   - `lookup_device`  <-> `GET /api/v1/devices/{id}`  (MCP `get_agent_details`)
///
/// The store-backed factory (`make_local_device_api`) lives in the core-only
/// `device_api_local.hpp` — this header names no store type at all, not even
/// by forward declaration, so a presentation TU including it cannot reach one.
///
/// ── UNSCOPED DATA PROVIDER — READ BEFORE ADDING A CONSUMER (mirrors
/// compliance_api.hpp's identical banner) ──
/// `list_devices()` returns the registry's UNFILTERED, fleet-wide rows —
/// every connected agent, regardless of the caller's own management-group
/// confinement. This is a fan-out read of per-agent data (routed-concerns'
/// `authorize_list_read`/`require_fleet_read` MUST, ADR-0017 World A) —
/// EVERY consumer MUST apply the fleet-read/confinement gate appropriate to
/// its surface before serving this result to a caller. The seam itself is a
/// store-free DATA PROVIDER only; auth, confinement and audit live in the
/// consumer (route/MCP handler), not here.
///
/// ── #3564 POINT-LOOKUP NOTE — READ BEFORE CHANGING `lookup_device` ──
/// `lookup_device` MUST resolve via an O(1) registry point lookup
/// (`AgentRegistry::get_session`), NEVER a linear scan over the fleet. A scan
/// whose length distinguishes "exists but not in your scope" from
/// "nonexistent" is a caller-visible timing oracle (#3564) — the O(1) point
/// lookup keeps a genuine miss cost-symmetric with a hit at this layer, and
/// this method itself performs no scoping. The confinement decision belongs to
/// the consumer, which MUST apply its own confinement gate on the requested id
/// and deny an out-of-scope id BEFORE calling this method — flat `in_scope` for
/// the REST and MCP handlers, the ancestor-aware `scoped_perm_fn`
/// (`require_scoped_permission`) for the dashboard fragment handlers. Whichever
/// gate applies, an out-of-scope caller triggers ZERO backing read here and
/// cannot learn an id exists by timing or via the degraded (`kDegraded`) branch
/// (governance #3564, security-guardian + architect). Reaching `lookup_device`
/// implies the caller has already cleared its consumer's confinement gate.
