/// @file access_review_model.hpp
/// Pure read-model for Periodic Access Reviews (SOC 2 CC6.2) — a
/// cross-principal enumeration of the DIRECT role grants currently on record
/// across all three RBAC principal types (user / group / engine). No
/// route/store-write dependency: this file only READS other stores and
/// projects the result into `AccessReviewRow`. The persistence of a review
/// CAMPAIGN (which freezes a population and records reviewer decisions) is a
/// separate concern — `access_review_store.hpp`.
///
/// UP-1 (governance hardening round, HIGH — completeness): the export's
/// SPINE is the grant table, not any roster. `build_access_review` reads
/// EVERY `(principal_type, principal_id, role_name)` row on record via
/// `RbacStore::list_all_principal_roles_checked()` — one bulk read — and
/// groups it by principal. A principal holding a live grant ALWAYS produces
/// a row, even when its `principal_id` matches nothing in the
/// users/groups/engine-principal rosters (a since-deleted user, a stale IdP-
/// provisioned row, or an OIDC/SSO principal minted outside any roster,
/// e.g. `oidc:<iss>#<sub>`) — such a row is enriched as an "orphan"
/// (`display_name = principal_id`, `source = "orphan"`,
/// `lifecycle_state = "unknown"`) rather than silently omitted. The prior
/// design walked the three ROSTERS and asked RBAC per member — a grant
/// belonging to a principal outside every roster was a silent false
/// negative in exactly the evidence CC6.2 exists to produce; walking the
/// grant table directly makes that omission structurally impossible. The
/// rosters (`AuthDB::list_users`, `RbacStore::list_groups_checked`,
/// `EnginePrincipalStore::list_all_checked`) are still read, but only to
/// ENRICH a grant-table row with display metadata — a principal with ZERO
/// grants produces no row (nothing to review), which is the intended scope
/// narrowing: this export answers "who currently has access", not "who
/// exists".
///
/// R1 (error propagation, codex BLOCK): a compliance export that silently
/// drops rows on a transient read failure is worse than one that fails
/// loudly — a partial grant set that reads as "the complete list" is a false
/// negative in exactly the evidence this feature exists to produce.
/// `build_access_review` therefore returns `std::unexpected` on the FIRST
/// read failure it hits (across the grant table, role-permission table,
/// users, groups, engine principals, and API tokens) and NEVER a partial
/// result. Every bulk read this function drives uses a
/// `std::expected`-returning accessor; five of those accessors
/// (`RbacStore::list_all_principal_roles_checked`,
/// `list_all_role_permissions_checked`, `get_role_permissions_checked`,
/// `list_groups_checked`, `EnginePrincipalStore::list_all_checked`) were
/// added/exist specifically because the pre-existing bare-vector form
/// swallows a query error to an indistinguishable-from-empty result — see
/// the doc comments on those methods. Roster reads (users/groups/engines)
/// are enrichment-only in the row-population sense (UP-1 above) but are
/// STILL required reads here — a dropped roster read would silently blank
/// every row's display metadata rather than fail loudly, which R1 rules
/// out just as much as a dropped grant read would.
///
/// R2 (per-principal-type permission computation, codex BLOCK, perf-
/// hardened): `RbacStore::get_effective_permissions(username)` is
/// USER-keyed — it resolves direct user grants, group-membership-derived
/// grants, AND direct engine grants via one three-way UNION
/// (`RbacStore::collect_roles_locked`). Calling it with a GROUP name would
/// silently look up `principal_type='user' AND principal_id=<group name>`
/// plus a (vacuous) group-membership check for a "user" named after the
/// group — never the group's own grants. This model therefore NEVER calls
/// `get_effective_permissions`. Instead, for ALL principal types uniformly,
/// it expands the DIRECT role names a grant-table group already produced
/// (this is also why the exported `roles` field is direct-only, not
/// group-inheritance-resolved, for a user row: mirrors the no-admin
/// auditor route's own direct-grant-only treatment of engine principals) to
/// a distinct `allow`-permission set via a `role_name -> permission set`
/// map built ONCE from `list_all_role_permissions_checked()` — not
/// re-queried per role per principal, which is the perf fix for the N×M
/// fan-out the prior per-roster-member walk incurred. For an ENGINE
/// principal this produces the SAME result `get_effective_permissions
/// (engine_id)` would (the engine UNION arm in `collect_roles_locked` only
/// ever contributes an engine principal's own direct grants — engines are
/// never group members). For a USER this is narrower than
/// `get_effective_permissions` (it excludes group-inherited roles) — a
/// user's group-derived access is still fully visible in this same export,
/// on that GROUP's own row. A follow-up could add a "resolved effective
/// access" column that flattens group inheritance onto the user row;
/// deferred here to avoid inventing a reverse group-membership bulk
/// accessor RbacStore does not currently expose.
///
/// Not part of the R1 error-propagation contract: `ApiTokenStore` (used only
/// to enrich an engine row's `last_activity_ms` via its most recent
/// non-revoked credential's `last_used_at`) and `DirectorySync` (used only to
/// best-effort enrich a user row's `owner_or_email`) are OPTIONAL enrichment
/// — a null pointer, or (for DirectorySync, whose `get_synced_users` has no
/// `std::expected` surface at all) an empty/unavailable read, degrades that
/// one field rather than failing the whole export. A genuine
/// `ApiTokenStore::list_tokens` READ FAILURE (store present, query erred)
/// DOES propagate — the pointer being present makes it part of the read set
/// this call promised to read completely.
