/// @file command_outbox_delivery.hpp
/// WS-3 slice 3.3 (ADR-2002 §6): the leader-gated delivery loop that drains the
/// `command_outbox_store` and performs the actual wire dispatch. This is the
/// "drive `pending → sent`" half of the transactional outbox — a producer
/// (`ScheduleRunner`) commits a `pending` occurrence; a crash before the wire
/// send leaves it `pending`; this loop re-drives it. Effectively-once holds
/// because every dispatch carries the occurrence's STABLE `command_id` and the
/// agent dedups on it (WS-0) — a re-drive of an already-delivered command is
/// suppressed at the endpoint, never re-executed.
///
/// THREE LOAD-BEARING RULES (an adversarial review of the plan made all three
/// binding):
///
///  R1 — NO ADR-1007 concurrency claim on delivery. This loop dispatches
///  through the PLAIN confined path (`DispatchFn` below), never the
///  concurrency-gated one. A concurrency claim keyed on `(command_id, agent_id)`
///  would, on a re-drive of the SAME stable command_id, fail-closed-exclude
///  every device that still holds the first attempt's open claim, so the
///  re-drive would read `sent=0` and be misread as "reached nobody" (and its
///  leak-release could free the live first-attempt claim). The agent's
///  command_id dedup already provides effectively-once; a re-delivered device
///  is a no-op at the endpoint, which is the correct "already delivered".
///
///  Re-authorization at SEND time — authority may have been revoked between
///  enqueue and delivery (a role dropped, a schedule re-pointed). Every
///  occurrence re-runs `arming_check(principal, plugin, action)` fresh; a denial
///  is a PERMANENT `mark_failed`, never a silent send. The caller is
///  re-resolved from the stored `principal` (never a serialized `DispatchCaller`
///  — that would re-create the #1398 provenance-forgery hazard); the approval
///  PROVENANCE that admitted the occurrence is carried on the row's
///  `approval_id` and stamped here (this loop is the declared #1398 stamping
///  site for outbox dispatch — see `dispatch_caller.hpp`'s closed list).
///
///  Fenced marks — `mark_sent` / `mark_failed` / `reschedule` embed the leader
///  epoch (read once per tick from the elector). A stale ex-leader is fenced out
///  of the state change; the row stays `pending` for the true leader (the
///  duplicate send it may already have made is absorbed by command_id dedup).
///
/// OUTCOME discrimination (fire-and-advance, matching `ScheduleRunner`'s
/// historical discipline): a systemic transient gate failure
/// (`containment_unreadable`) → `reschedule` with back-off (retry, DON'T mark
/// sent); authority revoked → `mark_failed`; every other outcome — including
/// `sent == 0` because the targeted agents are offline right now — → `mark_sent`
/// (a missed occurrence is recorded and skipped, never spun into a backlog).
