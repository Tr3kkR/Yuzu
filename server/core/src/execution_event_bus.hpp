/// PR 3 — per-execution SSE event bus for live drawer updates.
///
/// Distinct from `detail::EventBus` (global pub/sub keyed only by event_type):
/// `ExecutionEventBus` partitions subscribers by `execution_id` so that one
/// running execution's transitions never spray onto another execution's SSE
/// connections. Each per-execution channel carries its own ring buffer
/// (default 1000 events, ~30 s) so a client that disconnects and reconnects
/// inside the replay window resumes without missing transitions.
///
/// Threading model:
///   - `publish` is called from `ExecutionTracker::update_agent_status`
///     (status writer) and `mark_cancelled` — both synchronous w.r.t. the
///     mutating gRPC writer threads. `publish` therefore must not block.
///   - `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` are called from the SSE handler running
///     on the httplib request thread.
///   - All listeners run under the per-execution mutex; the listener body
///     should be short — typically queue-and-notify on a per-connection
///     `SseSinkState`.
///
/// Bounded memory: per execution, the ring buffer caps at `kBufferCap`
/// entries; old entries are dropped FIFO. When an execution reaches a
/// terminal state, the channel is held for `kRetentionAfterTerminalSec`
/// so a late client can still replay the final transitions, then dropped.
/// `gc_terminal_channels` performs the cleanup; the server calls it on
/// a periodic tick (or on every `publish`, opportunistically).
