/// @file leader_elector.hpp
/// WS-3 (ADR-2002 §3/§6/§10): a FENCED, Postgres-backed leader elector — the
/// coordination primitive that lets exactly one core replica run the singleton
/// background loops (schedule tick, policy remediation, reconcilers) once a
/// second replica is enabled. This file is the PRIMITIVE only (slice 3.1); no
/// loop gates on it yet, so building this changes no runtime behaviour.
///
/// THE FENCING MODEL (read before touching this — it is the whole point).
/// A Postgres *session* advisory lock gives mutual exclusion only while its
/// owning connection lives; it says NOTHING about a *paused* former leader
/// resuming work after the lock silently moved to a new backend (network blip,
/// primary failover). So leadership is NOT proven by "I hold the lock" — it is
/// proven by a **monotonically-increasing epoch**:
///
///   * On each successful acquire, the elector mints a fresh epoch from a
///     Postgres SEQUENCE (`leader_epoch_seq`) and records it as
///     `leader_state.current_leader_epoch` — done ON the lock-owning
///     connection, so mutual exclusion guarantees only the true holder writes
///     it, and each new leader's epoch is strictly greater than any prior one.
///   * Every SIDE-EFFECTING claim (slices 3.3/3.4, on an ORDINARY pooled
///     connection) embeds the `epoch_fence_sql()` predicate
///     (`current_leader_epoch == expected_epoch`) INTO its claim's WRITE
///     statement, so the epoch is verified ATOMICALLY with the side effect. A
///     stale ex-leader's cached epoch is < the current one, so the guarded write
///     admits zero rows even in the window before it notices its lock dropped.
///     THIS is the correctness guarantee. There is deliberately NO standalone
///     boolean fence read: a check-then-act read (`if (current) { claim(); }`)
///     races a handover between the read and the claim commit.
///
/// `is_leader()` gates only WHETHER TO ATTEMPT work; the `epoch_fence_sql()`
/// predicate embedded in the claim's write is what makes a stale leader's write
/// fail. A boolean "I am leader" cached and trusted OUTSIDE the lock connection
/// is PROHIBITED (ADR-2002 §6) — it is exactly the paused-ex-leader hazard the
/// epoch closes.
///
/// TWO DISPATCH PLANES (ADR-2002 Decision 1, plan §1a). The epoch fence gates
/// LEADER-DRIVEN BACKGROUND dispatch ONLY. Operator-triggered SYNCHRONOUS
/// dispatch (e.g. `PolicyEvaluator::remediate`/`evaluate_now`, REST handlers)
/// runs on whichever active-active replica received the request — frequently a
/// non-leader — and MUST NOT be epoch-fenced or it regresses the active-active
/// operator plane. Those paths are arbitrated by their own per-occurrence
/// durable CAS, never by this epoch. Do not embed `epoch_fence_sql()` on an
/// operator-synchronous path.
///
/// CONNECTION OWNERSHIP (ADR-2002 §10). The elector owns ONE dedicated,
/// never-recycled, lifetime-owned libpq connection — NOT a `pg_pool`
/// checkout-per-op lease (a recycled connection would drop the session lock).
/// A transaction-mode pooler must not front it (it breaks backend affinity for
/// session advisory locks). HAProxy-to-primary (WS-7) preserves affinity and is
/// compatible. `epoch_fence_sql()` is a pure string builder (no connection); the
/// SQL it returns is the one part of the fence that executes on a CALLER's
/// pooled connection, inside the caller's own claim statement.
