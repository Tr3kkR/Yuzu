/// @file runtime_config_store.hpp
/// Migrated Postgres store (ADR-0006/0009/0060, schema `runtime_config_store`).
/// Persistent runtime configuration overrides — key/value pairs that override
/// startup defaults (CLI/env). Only a fixed allow-list of keys is accepted
/// (`allowed_keys()`); one of them (`oidc_client_secret`) is a credential.
///
/// **Posture: AUTHORITATIVE / fail-closed (ADR-0012 §1).** Runtime config
/// feeds auth/OIDC behaviour (the startup override pass populates
/// `cfg_.oidc_client_secret`) and DEX alerting config — a silently-empty
/// read on a degraded store is a fail-open, not a benign "nothing
/// configured". `get_all()`/`get()` return `std::expected<..., std::string>`
/// (ADR-0036 typed-read policy) so a genuine DB error is never collapsed
/// into "no overrides set". `get_value()` stays a plain `std::string`
/// convenience wrapper — deliberately NOT widened. Every current call site
/// was audited (kickoff review, 2026-08-25): DEX alert-routing knobs are
/// deny-or-benign (a degraded read just means no routes/defaults, not a
/// security decision); `plugin_signing_required` feeds only a UI status
/// badge and an admin-only manual-fetch distribution endpoint (`GET
/// /api/v1/agent/plugin-policy` — server-side pack-install enforcement is
/// gated by `ProductPackStore::require_signed_packs_`, set from the CLI
/// flag at boot, never from this store; confirmed no agent code consumes
/// that route today, `agents/` grep). If a future caller wires either into
/// a real grant/enforce/skip decision, it MUST switch to `get()` and treat
/// `unexpected` as fail-closed — this deferral is explicit, per the
/// playbook's "say so" escape hatch, not an oversight.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008): the store holds a `pg::PgPool&` (not a
/// `sqlite3*`), runs its schema migration at construction on a pinned,
/// unbounded, construction-only lease, and schema-qualifies every runtime
/// statement (`runtime_config_store.*`) — pooled connections carry no
/// per-store `search_path`. Mutate-and-return uses `RETURNING` (the
/// #1033-banning idiom), never `sqlite3_changes()`.
///
/// **Secrets (ADR-0010): per-KEY, not per-column — `is_secret_config_key()`
/// decides.** Storage discrimination is a TABLE split, not a nullable
/// column: a secret key's non-empty value lives ONLY in
/// `runtime_config_secrets.sealed_value` (SecretCodec envelope, one row per
/// secret key, `key` as the AAD pk_column — mirrors `PluginConfigStore`'s
/// `configs`/`secrets` split, ADR-3005, the closest existing precedent for
/// "some keys in this namespace are secret, most aren't"); every other
/// value — including an EMPTY secret — lives in the plain `runtime_config`
/// table. `get_all()`/`get()` read BOTH tables in one statement and let a
/// `runtime_config_secrets` row win when present (see `set()`'s doc comment
/// for the becomes-secret-later story); `read_secret()` — the only accessor
/// that returns a real decrypted value — checks `runtime_config_secrets`
/// first and falls back to a non-empty plain-table row for the SAME
/// transitional state (never decrypting there, since there is nothing
/// encrypted to decrypt). Presence in `runtime_config_secrets` is still a
/// HARD invariant that the row is never empty, so `set()` never encrypts an
/// empty string — it
/// deletes any stale ciphertext row instead and stores `value=''` in the
/// plain table (same table an empty NON-secret value would use), which is
/// what lets an empty secret keep its `updated_by`/`updated_at`
/// attribution (see the redaction test) without ever holding a live DEK
/// over zero bytes. Own `SecretCodec` instance (ADR-0010 per-store model,
/// AuthDB/PluginConfigStore precedent): the caller constructs one over the
/// shared `FileKeyProvider` and passes it in; this store's constructor
/// registers `runtime_config_secrets.sealed_value` immediately after its
/// own schema migration, and the caller runs `SecretCodec::init()` on a
/// pinned lease right after construction returns (register-before-init).
///
/// **Concurrent `set()` on the SAME secret key is serialized by a
/// transaction-scoped advisory lock** (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(
/// 'runtime_config_store:secret:' || key, 0))`, taken first inside the
/// transaction, mirrors `ResultSetStore::pin`'s per-owner lock convention).
/// Without it, two concurrent `PUT`s on the same secret key — one clearing
/// it, one setting a real value — could interleave across their independent
/// transactions so the clearing caller received `applied:true` while the
/// concurrently-set secret silently survived (governance Gate 4/5 chaos-
/// confirmed finding, derives HIGH/BLOCKING: I3 wrong-result-presented-as-
/// correct). `set()` on a NON-secret key needs no lock — it is already one
/// atomic `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` statement.
///
/// **Backfill: SKIPPED unconditionally (ADR-0009's 2026-08-25
/// fresh-start-by-default amendment).** No `migrate_from_sqlite()` — the
/// legacy `runtime-config.db` is never COPIED. No production fleet has
/// ever run a pre-Postgres Yuzu build, so the original per-store-ADR
/// "mandatory backfill for config/reference stores" default assumed a
/// live fleet that has never existed. On cutover the server logs a boot
/// warning (`server.cpp`'s construction site) noting the reset, mirroring
/// `ResponseStore`/ADR-0039's reference shape for the skippable class.
///
/// **Detect-and-warn, per `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`'s Backfill
/// bullet.** Unlike `ResponseStore` (purely TTL'd telemetry — a silent
/// reset is genuinely benign), this store holds real operator-authored
/// config, so a silent reset would be a fail-open if the "no production
/// fleet" premise ever turns out to be locally wrong. `warn_if_legacy_data_present()`
/// opens the legacy file READ-ONLY (never migrates, never mutates, never
/// moves it aside) purely to check whether it exists and holds any rows;
/// the caller logs a loud, count-bearing warning only when it does —
/// silence is the expected, unremarkable case for a genuinely fresh
/// install (no legacy file, or an empty one), not something to warn
/// about on every start. This check only ever inspects the LEGACY
/// SQLite file — it does not, and cannot, tell whether an operator has
/// already reapplied a warned-about override via Settings, so it
/// deliberately re-warns on EVERY boot the legacy file still holds
/// rows, not only the first one after cutover (an operator who has
/// reapplied every override and wants silence must remove or empty the
/// legacy file — see `docs/user-manual/upgrading.md`'s RuntimeConfigStore
/// section).
