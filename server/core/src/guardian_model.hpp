/// Pure, no-httplib READ models shared by REST and MCP for the Guardian /
/// Guaranteed State surface (#4037, api-parity programme #2146 Batch A).
///
/// Follows the SAME real precedent as `access_review_model.hpp` /
/// `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` / `network_perf_model.hpp` — every function here
/// returns a plain value type (struct / vector / optional), never a JSON
/// string. `docs/api-twin-recipe.md` §1's own worked example (§8) shows a
/// JSON-string-returning shared builder, but that section is explicitly
/// illustrative-only ("no source files change as part of #3993, which is
/// docs-only") — no shipped model file in this tree actually does that,
/// because `JObj`/`JArr` are each defined LOCALLY inside `rest_api_v1.cpp`
/// and `mcp_server.cpp` (there is no header-exposed shared JSON builder to
/// return a string built from). What actually cannot drift between REST and
/// MCP by construction is the DATA — which store method gets called, with
/// what filter, and what it means — so that is what lives here. Each
/// transport still writes its own few lines of `JObj`/`JArr` field
/// enumeration over the struct returned below; that enumeration is
/// mechanical (list the struct's own fields) and low-risk compared to the
/// query/computation logic these functions centralise.
///
/// All four functions return `std::optional`/`nullopt` on a degraded store
/// read (ADR-0038 catastrophic-read set) — the caller MUST 503 (REST) or
/// otherwise refuse to render, never render an empty/zero result that would
/// misreport the fleet as compliant or a rule as having no reporting agents.
