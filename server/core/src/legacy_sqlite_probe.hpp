/// Fresh-start-by-default (ADR-0009 2026-08-25 amendment) detect-and-warn
/// helper, shared by every server store that migrates off its own SQLite
/// file with NO data backfill. `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`'s Backfill
/// bullet requires this: skip the legacy-file *copy*, but still check
/// whether the file exists and holds operator-authored rows, and `warn` if
/// so — so an environment where "no production fleet has ever run a
/// pre-Postgres build" turns out to be locally wrong gets a loud signal
/// instead of the silent data loss a bare skip would otherwise produce.
/// Modeled on `RuntimeConfigStore::warn_if_legacy_data_present`
/// (`runtime_config_store.cpp`), generalized from that store's single named
/// table to an arbitrary table list so a multi-table store (`DirectorySync`,
/// `PatchManager`) can reuse it directly.
///
/// Never reads column data, never mutates the legacy file, never itself
/// constitutes a backfill — this is detection only.
///
/// `warn_if_legacy_rows` itself has no 0600/sidecar hardening. ADR-0010
/// §Consequences (a)'s "force 0600 before the first read" obligation applies
/// specifically to a legacy file that may hold a PLAINTEXT secret column
/// (`RuntimeConfigStore`, `WebhookStore`); a caller whose legacy table(s)
/// hold no secret material has no such obligation and can call
/// `warn_if_legacy_rows` as-is. A secret-bearing caller instead calls
/// `harden_legacy_file_0600` (below) FIRST — extending this header per its
/// own instruction rather than forking a bespoke copy, #3623/WebhookStore
/// the first consumer (superseding `migrate_from_sqlite_impl`'s own inline
/// 0600+sidecar block, PR #3563).
