/// Pure device-CI enrichment for the /inventory Devices-tab roster (PR2). Attaches

/// from a pre-fetched `agent_id -> DeviceCiRecord` map.
///
/// Split out of server.cpp's `inv_devices_fn` so the confinement contract is
/// unit-testable without a live Postgres pool or full `ServerImpl`: the CONFINEMENT
/// itself happens upstream, in `inv_devices_fn`'s `visible_set_fn` filter (ADR-0017)
/// — `attach_device_ci` never re-derives visibility. It only ever looks up
/// `ci_by_agent` BY the agent_id already present in `rows`; it never iterates
/// `ci_by_agent`'s keys to manufacture a row. So an out-of-scope agent's CI entry
/// riding along in the same `list_device_ci(0)` read is inert — it is looked at,
/// never attached, and never rendered.
