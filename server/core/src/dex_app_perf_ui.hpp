/// Slice-2 dashboard renderers for DEX app-perf-over-time — the app picker + the
/// per-(app,version) trend table (fleet B2 or named-group B1). PURE free functions
/// over the reduced model (`app_perf_version_summaries`), so the HTMX surface, the
/// REST endpoints, and the MCP tools all read the SAME numbers. Declared here (not
/// in the already-large dex_routes.hpp) so the renderer + its scope-selector type
/// stay a small, separately-testable unit.
///
/// #4626 Concern B: includes the PURE halves directly (`dex_app_perf_pure.hpp`
/// for `AppPerfVersionSummary`/`AppPerfDeviceApp`, `app_perf_types.hpp` for
/// `AppPerfAppSummary`/`AppPerfVersionDeviceRow`) rather than the store-coupled
/// umbrella `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` (which also pulls `dex_app_perf_builders.hpp`
/// — the B1/B2 store headers) — this header + `dex_app_perf_ui.cpp` are enrolled
/// in `scripts/ci/check-seam-closure.py`'s `dex_perf` family, so a store
/// `#include` here is now lint-caught, not just reviewed.

/// mirroring `GET /dex/perf/app?version=`) when one is selected; `versions` then
/// carries just that one entry. `active_version` empty (the default) = all

/// independent scope selector alongside the management-group one — empty hides
/// it, same convention as `groups`. `active_model` mirrors `scope_group_id`'s
/// convention (empty = unfiltered). The two scopes are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE in
/// this slice (group takes precedence — see dex_routes.cpp's route handler);
/// selecting one clears the other via the emitted links so a caller can never
/// land on a URL naming both from this UI (a hand-edited URL naming both is
