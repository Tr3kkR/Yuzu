/// @file guardian_journal_fleet_tags.hpp
/// Reader side of the Guardian durable lifecycle-audit journal's fleet telemetry
/// (#2298 gate 3). Single source of truth for the `yuzu.guardian_journal_*` heartbeat
/// tag keys, the `yuzu_fleet_guardian_journal_*` gauge names they roll up into, their
/// HELP text, and the forged-value-safe parse of the agent-supplied values.
///
/// The writer is agents/core/src/guardian_journal_heartbeat.hpp
/// (`emit_guardian_journal_heartbeat_tags`). The two sides are bound by
/// tests/unit/server/test_guardian_journal_fleet_tags.cpp, which emits through the
/// agent's REAL emitter and asserts every key it produces is one this table
/// recognises. That test is the drift guard: a rename on either side without the
/// other is a red test, not a silently-dead gauge.
///
/// The keys are duplicated here rather than `#include`d from the agent header ON
/// PURPOSE. Server production code including an agent private header would add an
/// upward server -> agent dependency edge that the build graph does not have and must
/// not gain (the constraint is recorded verbatim in tests/meson.build, governance
/// Gate-3 architect, on the sibling spark pin). Only the TEST target carries the
/// agent include path, which is exactly where the bind belongs.
///
/// ── SHAPE: FLAT AND UNLABELLED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// One gauge per counter, NO labels - deliberately not the `{stat,os}` distribution
/// shape `yuzu_fleet_net_*` / `yuzu_fleet_perf_*` use (design item 9,
/// "unlabeled/low-cardinality"). These are integrity and loss signals, not
/// distributions: the fleet question is "did ANY endpoint lose a lifecycle record",
/// which a sum answers and a percentile obscures. 27 families, 27 series, no
/// agent-controlled label anywhere - so no cardinality exposure at all (contrast the
/// `os`-labelled families, which need an allowlist).
///
/// ── WHAT ABSENCE MEANS, MECHANICALLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
/// This section states the emission MECHANICS only. It deliberately does not tell the
/// reader what a value or an absence PROVES about fleet health - six review rounds of
/// this file each produced exactly one wrong interpretive claim, so the interpretation
/// now belongs to whoever enables these at the cutover, with a live journal to test
/// readings against.
///
/// The writer is SPARSE: a counter that is 0 ships no tag.
/// `AgentHealthStore::recompute_metrics` `clear_gauge_family()`s all 27 at the top of
/// every sweep and re-publishes only those at least one retained agent reported this
/// cycle. So an absent family means: no retained agent's latest heartbeat carried a
/// value for it that PASSED the forged-value parse. Note both edges, each pinned by a
/// test in tests/unit/server/test_agent_health_store.cpp: a non-conforming agent's
/// explicit "0" parses and PUBLISHES the family at 0, and a rejected non-zero value
/// (over the ceiling, say) leaves it ABSENT while incrementing `..._tag_rejected`.
///
/// The two META-SIGNALS below are NOT in the table and are published on every completed
/// sweep INCLUDING at 0, so they are never absent once a sweep has completed. That is
/// their point (a 0 from a server-owned count is a measurement, not a fabricated zero)
/// and also their limit: because they are never cleared, `MetricsRegistry` retains the
/// last value indefinitely, so NEITHER `absent(..._reporting)` NOR `..._reporting == 0`
/// detects a STALLED sweep - a stall freezes the previous sample in place. Use
/// `yuzu_server_reaper_sweep_duration_seconds` for sweep liveness. An earlier revision
/// of this header claimed `absent()` covered a stall; it does not, and the comment at
/// the publish site in agent_registry.cpp ("never goes stale") is exactly why.
///
/// ── NOT HERE YET ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// `gauge_underflow` (GuardianLifecycleJournal::gauge_underflow()) is deliberately
/// absent: it is not in GuardianJournalStats or the heartbeat emit yet, and wiring it
/// there is cutover-gated on `prefer_spark` (commit 1ffa4299). When it lands, adding
/// it here is ONE table row - the clear, accumulate, publish and describe loops are
