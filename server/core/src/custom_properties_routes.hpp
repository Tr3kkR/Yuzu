/// @file custom_properties_routes.hpp
/// Extracted from server.cpp's inline registrations onto the HttpRouteSink
/// seam (#2542 PR-4) — the 5-route Custom Properties API (7.6): typed
/// operator-authored per-agent metadata (`props.<key>` in scope
/// expressions) plus its optional per-key type/validation schemas. One
/// owning store (`CustomPropertiesStore`), genuinely cohesive — matching
/// PR-2's "single subsystem" grouping precedent rather than PR-3's
/// explicitly-heterogeneous one. Every handler body is copied verbatim from
/// server.cpp; the changes are the receiver (`web_server_->` -> `sink.`),
/// the gate closures (`require_scoped_permission`/`require_permission` ->
/// `deps.scoped_perm_fn`/`deps.perm_fn`), the member access
/// (`custom_properties_store_.` -> `deps.store->`), and the audit call
/// (`audit_log(...)` -> `deps.audit_fn(...)`, already hoisted in
/// server.cpp as `audit_fn`).
///
/// `is_custom_properties_db_error` (the `kCustomPropertiesDbErrorPrefix`
/// classifier distinguishing a genuine store/DB failure from a caller-input
/// validation error) moves here verbatim from server.cpp's anonymous
/// namespace — it had exactly two call sites, both in the routes this file
/// now owns, and no dependency on `ServerImpl` state.
///
/// Routes (5) — gate in parens, all backed by `deps.store`
/// (`CustomPropertiesStore`):
///   GET    /api/agents/:id/properties        (scoped_perm_fn Infrastructure:Read, agent_id)
///   PUT    /api/agents/:id/properties/:key   (scoped_perm_fn Infrastructure:Write, agent_id)
///   DELETE /api/agents/:id/properties/:key   (scoped_perm_fn Infrastructure:Write, agent_id)
///   GET    /api/property-schemas             (perm_fn Infrastructure:Read)
///   POST   /api/property-schemas             (perm_fn Infrastructure:Write)
///
/// #3700: the three per-agent routes gate on PER-TARGET
/// `require_scoped_permission`, never a bare global `require_permission` —
/// the old global gate admitted a permission holder with no target check,
/// disclosing/mutating custom-properties data for agents outside a
/// management-group-confined caller's scope (World A gap, ADR-0017). The
/// two schema routes are deliberately NOT per-target (a schema is a global
/// definition, not a per-agent value) and keep the plain `perm_fn` gate,
/// matching server.cpp's original code exactly.
///
/// AUDIT ASYMMETRY (preserved verbatim, not a defect introduced by this
/// move): both GET routes are unaudited (pure reads); PUT/DELETE
/// property audit both their failure and success outcomes; POST
/// /api/property-schemas audits ONLY success — a validation/db failure on
/// schema upsert returns its error response with no matching audit call.
/// This is the pre-existing server.cpp behaviour, copied as-is; it is not
/// this extraction's place to change it.
