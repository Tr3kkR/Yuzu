/// @file legacy_self_service_allow.hpp
/// The ONE place the legacy (RBAC-off) self-service allowlist is decided
/// (#2963).
///
/// THE DEFECT: RBAC ships OFF by default, and with RBAC off
/// `AuthRoutes::require_permission` / `require_scoped_permission` fall
/// through to the legacy branch, which denies every non-`Read` operation to
/// a non-admin caller. `ApiToken:Rotate` was introduced so a token OWNER
/// could rotate their own credential — self-service credential hygiene —
/// but composed with the legacy admin-only rule it was reachable by nobody
/// except an admin in the shipped default configuration, which is not the
/// population the feature was built for (#2963).
///
/// THE RULE: a (securable, operation) pair on this list is treated like
/// `Read` in the legacy branch ONLY — i.e. it does not by itself require an
/// admin role. This is SAFE ONLY because this gate decides "may attempt",
/// never "may act on resource X": every pair here has its OWN independent,
/// unconditional ownership check downstream in the store the route calls
/// into (for `ApiToken:Rotate`, `ApiTokenStore::rotate_token`/
/// `confirm_token_rotation` refuse any `requesting_user` other than the
/// resolved row's own `principal_id` — no admin override), so admitting a
/// non-admin caller past THIS gate grants them nothing beyond their own
/// resource.
///
/// A pair belongs here iff ALL of:
///   (a) the operation is inherently self-targeted — the caller can only
///       ever act on their OWN principal's own resource, never another's;
///   (b) the backing store enforces that ownership unconditionally, with no
///       admin/service-account override, on every call path that can reach
///       it; and
///   (c) admitting a non-admin caller here grants no new AUTHORITY beyond
///       what they already hold over their own resource (rotation, for
///       example, can never mint a credential broader than the one being
///       rotated — see api_token_store.cpp's authority-inheritance guard).
///
/// This mirrors `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/me`, which does not go through
/// `require_permission` at all for the identical reason (self-service,
/// ownership-enforced, recoverable) — `ApiToken:Rotate` could not take that
/// same "skip the gate entirely" shape because the RBAC-ON path needs its
/// OWN dedicated `ApiToken:Rotate` grant to stay meaningful (a non-admin
/// role must be explicitly granted it there); this allowlist applies ONLY
/// inside the legacy RBAC-OFF branch, strictly below the live-RBAC check,
/// and never overrides a live RBAC grant or denial.
///
/// EXTEND this set, never fork it — same discipline as
/// `authz_topology_floor.hpp`'s `kTopologyFloor` (which floors the OPPOSITE
/// direction: pairs that must stay admin-only regardless of the toggle).
/// The two lists are deliberately separate: one narrows the legacy
/// fallback, this one widens a single self-targeted exception within it.
