/// @file app_perf_daily_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres per-device daily app-performance summary — layer **B1** of
/// the DEX app-perf-over-time feature (schema `app_perf_daily_store`). One row
/// per `(agent_id, app_name, version, day)`: the daily roll-up of the agent's
/// on-device `procperf_hourly` warehouse, shipped centrally over the daily-sync
/// `app_perf` source so fleet-wide questions ("which devices ran v124, and how
/// did it perform") are answerable WITHOUT federating to every endpoint.
///
/// ── Deliberate design choices (these surprise a reader of SoftwareInventoryStore) ──
///
/// **Hash-less.** Unlike SoftwareInventoryStore, this store persists NO content
/// hash. app_perf's per-day window changes daily, so the daily-sync hash-skip is
/// moot — the agent always sends full. A hash-only `app_perf` report (only a
/// same-day re-tick / need_full retry produces one) is therefore answered with
/// `need_full` by the ingest seam, never matched here. The big consequence: the
/// byte-identical agent↔server canonicalization burden that the installed_software
/// path carries (a one-sided change → permanent always-full) does NOT apply — the
/// wire blob only needs to be PARSEABLE, not hash-reproducible.
///
/// **Top-N scope, not a census.** `procperf` records only the per-tick top-10-CPU
/// ∪ top-10-working-set apps, so this store covers a device's RESOURCE-SIGNIFICANT
/// app-versions, NOT every app that ran. "Which devices ran app X" is qualified to
/// "…among that device's top resource consumers". A complete app-presence census is
/// `installed_software` (SoftwareInventoryStore), a different store.
///
/// **Version is canonicalized at ingest** via `yuzu::util::canon_version` — the
/// SAME function the crash/stability side applies — so a future fleet view can
/// join perf (B1/B2) to stability `(app, version)`. Canonicalization can collapse
/// two raw versions onto one key, so `apply_daily` re-canons and MERGES collisions
/// (sample-weighted) before the batched upsert; otherwise the batch would hit
/// "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect row a second time".
///
/// ── Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012) ──
/// Holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at construction on a pinned lease,
/// schema-qualifies every runtime statement (`app_perf_daily_store.app_perf_daily`),
/// uses `RETURNING` for mutate-and-return. Plain indexed table + DELETE prune (NOT
/// native partitioning — the non-transactional migration kind it needs isn't built).
/// `updated_at` is the SERVER receipt time, bumped on every upsert (never the agent
/// clock — #1685 lesson).
///
/// ── Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1) ──
///   - **Data:** a projection — the agent + procperf are the source of truth.
///   - **Ingest:** fail-soft — a transient PG outage returns false; the agent
///     re-sends on its 2-day window next cycle (the window self-heals the gap).
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — a store/pool/query failure returns
///     `std::nullopt` (logged at warn), never a silent empty. `nullopt` = degraded
///     (could not read); an empty *value* = a genuine zero-row result. Callers MUST
///     surface a `nullopt` degrade, never `.value_or({})` it into a silent empty.
///
/// ── Read-surface parity carry-forward (agentic-first A1–A4) ──
/// 3a (this store) ships NO REST/MCP surface — only this C++ read, exercised by a
/// PostgresTestDb test (pipe + reservoir; nothing drinking yet). When the read
/// surface lands (slice 2 / B2) it extends the existing dex-perf family and MUST
/// ship REST + MCP **in the same PR** (never REST-first), A4-enveloped via
/// `rest_a4_envelope.hpp` (NOT legacy `error_json`; do not add to the #1470 debt),
/// A2-discoverable (openapi.json + tools/list), behind `GuaranteedState:Read` with
/// per-device audit via `rest_audit.hpp` (fail-closed 503).
