/// @file legacy_events_routes.hpp
/// Extracted from server.cpp's inline registrations onto the HttpRouteSink
/// seam (#2542 PR-12, the Infra/Misc bundle) — the single-route legacy
/// `GET /events` fleet-wide SSE dashboard stream (pre-dates the W5.1
/// agentic-first `GET /api/v1/events` in `rest_api_v1.cpp`, which stays the
/// canonical taxonomy per `docs/executions-history-ladder.md` — this route
/// is the OLDER `detail::EventBus`-backed stream, not a second copy of the
/// newer one).
///
/// SSE-EXTRACTION SAFETY (checked, not assumed — see PR-12's own
/// governance-ledger self-review entry for the full note): the task brief
/// for this extraction flagged this route as a candidate to defer if
/// genuinely incompatible with `HttpRouteSink`'s synchronous
/// request/response model. It is NOT incompatible. `GET /api/v1/events`
/// (`rest_api_v1.cpp`) is the existing, in-production precedent — it is
/// ALREADY registered through this exact seam (`sink.Get("/api/v1/events",
/// ...)`) and already carries its own `TestRouteSink` coverage
/// (`test_rest_api_events.cpp`), whose own file header documents precisely
/// this boundary: the synchronous handler phase (auth -> gate -> admission
/// -> bus-subscribe -> `set_chunked_content_provider` registration) is
/// fully exercised through the sink; the wire-level chunked SSE framing
/// itself is deliberately NOT unit-tested (covered by UAT/integration
/// instead) because `TestRouteSink` does not drive httplib's actual socket
/// I/O loop. `HttplibRouteSink::Get` forwards byte-identically to
/// `httplib::Server::Get` in production, so nothing about moving this
/// route's REGISTRATION onto the sink changes its runtime behaviour — only
/// its TEST reachability changes (for the better: this route previously had
/// NO unit coverage at all). `test_legacy_events_routes.cpp` mirrors
/// `test_rest_api_events.cpp`'s split exactly.
///
/// Every handler body is copied verbatim from server.cpp; the changes are
/// the receiver (`web_server_->` -> `sink.`), the two gate closures
/// (`auth_routes_->deny_service_scoped_session` -> `deps.deny_service_scoped_fn`,
/// `auth_routes_->resolve_session` -> `deps.resolve_session_fn`), and the
/// member access (`stream_budget_.` -> `deps.stream_budget->`, `event_bus_`
/// -> `*deps.event_bus`).
///
/// ADMISSION CONTROL (ADR-0034): this route leases from the SAME
/// `deps.stream_budget` instance every other held-open response on the
/// shared httplib pool leases from (MCP GET, `/api/v1/events`, the
/// dashboard drawer) — `SseSurface::kLegacyEvents` already names this
/// specific surface in `stream_budget.hpp`. This move introduces NO new
/// admission-control surface and NO parallel counter.
///
/// EVENT BUS: this route subscribes to `deps.event_bus`
/// (`detail::EventBus`, the LEGACY dashboard bus) — it does NOT touch
/// `ExecutionEventBus`, so `docs/executions-history-ladder.md`'s "one bus,
/// one taxonomy" invariant is not implicated by this move (that invariant
/// governs `/api/v1/events`, not this pre-existing legacy stream).
///
/// Route (1) — gate in parens:
///   GET /events   (deny_service_scoped_fn "events.stream.access_denied",
///                  THEN a permissive best-effort `resolve_session_fn` call
///                  that only affects the per-principal admission-control
///                  bucket size — never a hard 401; the pre-routing
///                  chokepoint is the actual authentication gate for this
///                  route, exactly as documented in the handler's own
///                  in-body comment, preserved verbatim below)
