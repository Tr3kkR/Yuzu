/// @file rbac_store.hpp
/// Authorization substrate — role definitions, role→permission grants,
/// principal→role assignments, RBAC groups + membership, and the global
/// `rbac_enabled` flag. Born on SQLite (`rbac.db`), migrated to PostgreSQL
/// (ADR-0006/0007/0008/0009/0012, schema `rbac_store`; migration ADR-0041).
/// The LARGEST and highest-blast-radius store on the ladder: a migration
/// defect here is a FLEET-WIDE authorization failure.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement
/// (`rbac_store.roles`). No `sqlite3_changes()` (#1033) — mutators use
/// `RETURNING` / `PQcmdTuples`.
///
/// Failure posture (ADR-0041), the load-bearing invariant:
///  - **Authz reads FAIL CLOSED.** `check_permission` /
///    `check_scoped_permission` / `holds_permission_via_any_group` /
///    `check_role_has_permission` keep their `bool`/DENY-on-error contract: a
///    store-not-open, pool-acquire timeout, or query error returns `false`
///    (deny), NEVER `true`. The list/scope reads return the empty /
///    most-restrictive result on degrade. Callers that must distinguish
///    "denied" from "store degraded" (403 vs 503) use the `_checked`
///    (`std::expected`) accessors — the plain `bool`/vector paths stay
///    deny-on-error so no chokepoint can regress to fail-open.
///  - **Permission cache → shared durable generation token.** The
///    process-local `write_generation_` becomes a durable
///    `rbac_meta.write_generation` counter bumped IN THE SAME TXN as every
///    mutation. Each replica keeps its in-process `perm_cache_` but validates
///    it against the durable generation, refreshed at most once per
///    `kRbacGenerationRefreshMs`; on a generation change (a mutation on ANY
///    replica) or on ANY generation-read error it clears the cache (fail
///    toward "assume changed", never extend trust). Bounds cross-replica
///    stale-allow to the refresh interval.
///  - **Backfill: MANDATORY (ADR-0009/0041).** RBAC state is irreducible
///    operator intent (custom roles, every grant, groups, membership) that
///    cannot be re-derived — `migrate_from_sqlite` seeds defaults then
///    backfills operator rows (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`), idempotent / single-
///    shot (retried from scratch on interruption — not a cursor-resumed
///    stream, unlike AuditStore's larger dataset) / row-count reconciled, and
///    boot FAILS CLOSED on failure. The `rbac_enabled` flag is migrated FIRST
///    and read-back-verified — losing it silently reverts the fleet to
///    RBAC-off (catastrophic fail-open).
