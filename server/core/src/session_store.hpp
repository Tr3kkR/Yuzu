/**
 * session_store.hpp -- Durable operator sessions in Postgres (HA WS-1/1a, ADR-2002 §4)
 *
 * Moves operator sessions from `AuthManager`'s process-local `sessions_` map
 * (steady_clock, in-memory) to durable Postgres rows, so a session survives a
 * core-replica restart/failover and validates identically on any replica.
 *
 * This store is AUTHORITATIVE (ADR-0012 / postgres-store-playbook "Authoritative
 * reads"): a database error is type-distinguishable from "no such session" —
 * reads return `std::expected<std::optional<SessionRow>, Error>` where `nullopt`
 * means "definitively absent" and `unexpected` means "cannot tell" (a caller in
 * the auth path must NEVER treat a degraded read as "not a valid session" in a
 * way that silently grants; it fails the request rather than guessing).
 *
 * WALL-CLOCK, DB-CLOCK AUTHORITY (ADR-2002 §4, the reversal — completed WS-1/1a).
 * Sessions were in-memory on a MONOTONIC (steady_clock) clock specifically for
 * NTP-step resistance. Durability forces wall-clock. Every durable timestamp is
 * AUTHORED from Postgres `now()` (this store, in SQL), NOT the calling replica's
 * `system_clock` — so any replica dates a session in the ONE DB clock domain,
 * which is what fixes cross-HOST skew. Reads (`find`) return `db_now_ms` in the
 * same atomic SELECT; the caller adjudicates absolute expiry / idle / elevation /
 * MFA against `db_now_ms` and then derives a LOCAL MONOTONIC (steady_clock)
 * remaining-duration deadline for its per-request validate cache (AuthManager),
 * so the hot path touches neither the DB nor the local wall clock.
 *
 * A backward clock step on the DB primary is the residual the reversal admits (it
 * would lower `now()`, inflating a derived remaining, and un-expiring a session).
 * Four layered defences bound it (the store authors + reaps; AuthManager derives
 * + enforces):
 *   (1) the caller CLAMPS every derived remaining so a lowered `db_now` cannot
 *       inflate the LIVED duration past its authored maximum — elevation against
 *       `elevation_issued_ms + kMaxElevationWindow`, MFA against its window
 *       ceiling, the base session against `created_at_ms` (H2 in the design
 *       review — the ceilings clamp the derived remaining, not merely validate
 *       the stored width);
 *   (2) elevation carries an `elevation_issued_ms` anchor: `is_elevated()`
 *       rejects a window `elevated_until_ms - elevation_issued_ms` over the hard
 *       `kMaxElevationWindow` ceiling, AND a future issued-at; MFA rejects a
 *       future-dated proof (`mfa_verified_ms > db_now` treated as absent);
 *   (3) a LOCAL wall-clock sanity ceiling backstops steady_clock's suspend-
 *       blindness (a suspended replica's monotonic clock pauses and would else
 *       over-live a cached session — H5);
 *   (4) DB-primary clock integrity is a monitored security dependency: `reap`
 *       declines and raises `clock_anomaly` on a backward `now()`, alerted on
 *       (ADR-2002 §4 mitigation (a)).
 *
 * SECRET-AT-REST. The row key is a verify-only SHA-256 of the bearer session
 * token, never the raw token (a DB read must not yield a usable session cookie).
 * The caller hashes the token; this store only ever sees the hash.
 *
 * VALIDATE-CACHE (the rbac_store pattern). Per-request session validation must
 * not hit Postgres every call. AuthManager keeps a process-local cache validated
 * against a durable generation counter (`session_meta.write_generation`) that is
 * bumped IN THE SAME TXN as every membership/authz-affecting mutation (create,
 * invalidate, elevate, revoke-elevation, mfa-verify). `touch_activity` is a
 * sliding idle update and deliberately does NOT bump the generation. This store
 * owns the durable side (mutations bump; `read_generation()` reads); the cache
 * itself lives in AuthManager.
 *
 * RETENTION. `reap_expired()` is a wall-clock bulk delete, so once sessions are
 * durable it joins the clock-guarded-retention set (routed concern #2360/#2361 —
 * previously the in-memory monotonic sweep was exempt "by construction"). It is
 * single-writer-safe across replicas via a `pg_advisory_xact_lock` taken as its
 * own statement before the check-and-delete, and it is capped + guarded.
