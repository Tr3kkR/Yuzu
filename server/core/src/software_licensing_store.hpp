/// @file software_licensing_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres detected-licence store (ADR-0024 Decision 4, schema
/// `software_licensing_store`): per-agent detected licence rows for the
/// `software_licensing` daily-sync source, the compliance evaluator's posture
/// rollup, and the alert-dedup state behind the `software_license.expiring` /
/// `software_license.expired` events.
///
/// COEXISTS with `ProductRegistryStore` (canonical identities + match links)
/// — one-store-per-typed-domain is the established precedent; NO cross-schema
/// SQL or FKs (ADR-0024 Decision 4): cross-store joins happen in C++ in the
/// evaluator, never holding a lease across another store call.
///
/// HASH-SKIP DIVERGENCE (ADR-0024 Decision 3, roadmap D-2): unlike the three
/// legacy sources, this source's `content_hash` is the SHA-256 of the RAW
/// received blob bytes, recomputed by the ingest seam
/// (`software_licensing_ingestion`) — never re-derived from parsed rows and
/// never trusted from the agent's claim. The store therefore has NO
/// canonical_hash of its own: it persists the seam's hash verbatim and offers
/// the trichotomy primitives (`stored_hash` / `touch` /
/// `replace_agent_licenses`) the seam drives — stored (full payload
/// replaced), touched (hash matched, freshness bumped), need-full (no state
/// row or drifted hash → the framework's `need_full` lever, which is also the
/// forced-reprojection path per roadmap G-8).
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement,
/// uses `RETURNING`, bounded leases. Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1 / ADR-0024
/// Decision 4):
///   - **Ingest:** fail-soft — a transient PG outage returns false; the seam
///     nacks and the agent re-sends next cycle.
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — a store/pool/query failure returns
///     `std::nullopt` / `kDegraded` (logged at warn), NEVER a silent empty. A
///     silent-empty read on a compliance surface reads as "nothing detected /
///     nothing expired" — the fail-open lie ADR-0024 Decision 4 forbids. An
///     empty *value* = a genuine zero-row result.
///   - `first_seen`/`last_seen` on the state row are the **SERVER receipt
///     time**, never the agent-supplied `collected_at` (the #1685 lesson /
///     ADR-0016 clock-skew rule); the roadmap C-10 staleness read
///     (`count_stale_agents`) keys off them.
