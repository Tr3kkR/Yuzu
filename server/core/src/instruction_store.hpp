/// @file instruction_store.hpp
/// Migrated Postgres store (ADR-0006/0009/0058, schema `instruction_store`) for the content-plane
/// catalog `docs/Instruction-Engine.md` describes: `InstructionDefinition -> InstructionSet ->
/// ProductPack`. Two tables, no FK between them (`instruction_set_id` is a soft TEXT reference;
/// `delete_set` unsets it on referencing definitions rather than relying on a cascade).
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard, both construction and runtime — a
/// silent-empty definition read breaks dispatch (`execute_instruction` resolves definitions
/// here). `create_definition`/`update_definition`/`import_definition_json`/
/// `import_definition_json_trusted`/`create_set` already returned `std::expected`
/// pre-migration; `query_definitions`/`get_definition`/`list_sets`/`delete_definition`/
/// `delete_set`/`export_definition_json` are widened to `std::expected` here (ADR-0036
/// typed-read policy) so a genuine DB error is never collapsed into "no definitions" / "not
/// found" — matching `ProductPackStore::get`'s `std::expected<std::optional<T>, std::string>`
/// shape.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008): the store holds a `pg::PgPool&` (not a `sqlite3*`), runs its
/// schema migration at construction on a pinned lease, and schema-qualifies every runtime
/// statement. Mutate-and-return uses `RETURNING` where a caller needs to distinguish "inserted"
/// from "conflicted" — never a bare `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` on `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.
///
/// **Seed-vs-live semantics (ADR-0058, the headline decision).** The boot-time reseed loop
/// (`server.cpp`'s every-boot walk of `kBundledDefinitions`/`kBundledSets`) stays
/// conflict-skip-on-id-existence, content-blind, exactly as pre-migration — an operator's edit
/// to a bundled definition is never clobbered by a later reseed. Deletion, however, is now an
/// INTENTIONAL SUPPRESSION rather than a plain DELETE: `deleted_seed_content(kind, id)` records
/// every deleted definition/set id, consulted ONLY by the seed-aware insert paths below and by
/// `migrate_from_sqlite`'s backfill — never by any read path, any normal `create_definition`/
/// `create_set` call, or any authorization/targeting decision. This is a DELIBERATE BEHAVIOUR
/// CHANGE from the pre-migration SQLite store, which resurrected an operator-deleted bundled
/// definition on the very next boot (pinned and then inverted — see
/// `tests/unit/server/test_instruction_store.cpp` tag `[instruction_store][seed]`). See
/// `docs/adr/0058-instruction-store-postgres-migration.md` for the full reasoning, the
/// independent-model consult that informed it, and what this migration does NOT solve (an
/// untouched-but-stale bundled row never auto-refreshes to newer bundled content on a release
/// upgrade — flagged as a follow-up, not fixed here).
///
/// **Two named entry points make the seed-vs-tombstone distinction explicit at every call
/// site**, mirroring `import_definition_json`/`import_definition_json_trusted`'s existing
/// signature-trust-boundary pattern:
///   - `import_definition_json_trusted` (its own signature gate bypass is unchanged) now ALSO
///     routes through the seed-aware insert path internally — it is exclusively the boot-loop
///     caller (no REST/MCP/network surface reaches it, by design), so `!check_signature` is
///     already a sound proxy for "this is the reseed loop."
///   - `create_set_seed` is a NEW public method, the set-side seed-aware entry point (sets have
///     no signature concept at all — "seed" names the actual distinction being made, not
///     "trusted", which would misleadingly imply one). Plain `create_set` is unchanged — used by
///     the REST-facing "create a custom instruction set" route, no lock, no tombstone
///     consultation, exactly as before.
/// Callers of `create_set_seed` MUST be internal boot-time code — there is no REST/MCP/network
/// surface for this method by design, matching `import_definition_json_trusted`'s contract.
///
/// No secrets (ADR-0010 N/A): verified against `docs/Instruction-Engine.md`/
/// `docs/yaml-dsl-spec.md`, neither of which defines a secret-typed/credential-bearing YAML
/// field — the only crypto-adjacent fields are the definition's public `signature`/`publicKey`
/// pair (Ed25519), not secret material. Free-text columns are `sanitize_pg_text`'d before every
/// write (NUL-truncation hygiene over libpq's C-string text binding), applied AFTER signature
/// verification, over the pre-sanitized bytes — mirrors `product_pack_store.hpp`'s identical
/// note; `verify_signature` runs once over the exact bytes that were signed.
///
/// **No `mtx_`** (the pre-migration `shared_mutex` is dropped) — Postgres's MVCC + the pool's
/// own connection-level concurrency replace it, matching every other migrated store on the
/// ladder.
