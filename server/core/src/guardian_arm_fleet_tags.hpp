/// Reader side of the rung 9c PR-3 arm/disarm ack-ledger fleet telemetry
/// (docs/spark-stage2-guardian-consumer-design.md §R5.2;
/// ~/.claude/plans/spark-rung9c-pr3-telemetry-KICKOFF-v2.md Decision 1). Single
/// source of truth for the `yuzu.guardian_arm_*` heartbeat tag keys, the
/// `yuzu_fleet_guardian_arm_*` gauge names they roll up into, their HELP text,
/// and the forged-value-safe parse of the agent-supplied values.
///
/// The writer is agents/core/src/guardian_arm_heartbeat.hpp
/// (`emit_guardian_arm_heartbeat_tags`). Both sides are bound by
/// tests/unit/server/test_guardian_arm_fleet_tags.cpp, which emits through the
/// agent's REAL emitter and asserts every key produced is one the table here
/// recognises - the drift guard, same as guardian_journal_fleet_tags.hpp's own.
///
/// The keys are duplicated here rather than #include-d from the agent header ON
/// PURPOSE, for the exact reason guardian_journal_fleet_tags.hpp's own header
/// states: server production code including an agent private header would add an
/// upward server -> agent dependency edge the build graph does not have and must
/// not gain (tests/meson.build). Only the TEST target carries the agent include
/// path.
///
/// ── SHAPE: SUM, NOT MAX - THESE ARE GAUGES, NOT COUNTERS ────────────────────────
/// Unlike the journal family (32 monotonic per-sweep counters) or the age family
/// (staleness - rolls up as MAX), arm_pending/arm_failed are RE-STATABLE GAUGES:
/// each agent reports its CURRENT count, not a cumulative total, so the fleet
/// question ("how many accepted arms are outstanding/failed RIGHT NOW across the
/// fleet") is answered by a SUM of current values, not a SUM of deltas and not a
/// MAX. The two-row table below still accumulates via `+=` exactly like the
/// journal counter family mechanically (same accumulate-loop shape in
/// agent_registry.cpp) - the difference that matters is in the AGENT's own
/// emission posture (present-and-including-0 vs sparse-monotonic), which this
/// reader does not need to know about: an agent's CURRENT reading, present or
/// absent, is all this table consumes either way.
///
/// ── WHAT ABSENCE MEANS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
/// Same rule as every other family here: `AgentHealthStore::recompute_metrics`
/// clears both gauge families at the top of every sweep and re-publishes only
/// what at least one retained agent's latest heartbeat carried this cycle. An
/// absent family means no retained agent reported a parseable value THIS sweep -
/// which, for arm_pending/arm_failed specifically, includes every non-spark
/// (prefer_spark_ off) agent, by construction (see the writer's own Check A doc
/// comment): they never emit the pair at all, so they can never poison "absent"
/// into a false healthy zero.
