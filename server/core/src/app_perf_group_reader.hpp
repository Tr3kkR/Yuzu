/// @file app_perf_group_reader.hpp
/// Reader for the DEX app-perf-over-time **management-group** trend (slice 2):
/// the on-the-fly aggregate of B1 (`AppPerfDailyStore`, schema
/// `app_perf_daily_store`) over a supplied set of member `agent_id`s, for one app.
///
/// ── Why a dedicated reader, not a store method ──
/// It produces a B2-SHAPED aggregate (`AppPerfFleetRow` incl. the fixed-bucket
/// histogram) but reads the B1 schema — a composition that belongs in neither
/// per-store class: it borrows the pool (never a store lease), reuses the FROZEN
/// histogram scheme (`app_perf_hist.hpp`) and the writer's bucket-predicate SQL
/// builder (`AppPerfRollup::build_hist_array_sql`) so the GROUP histogram is
/// byte-for-byte the same scheme as B2's. The member list is resolved by the
/// caller (from `ManagementGroupStore`) and passed in — so this reader touches
/// exactly ONE schema, and the two reads (members, then aggregate) are bounded
/// single-store leases composed in the provider, never one lease held across the
/// other (ADR-0012 §1).
///
/// ── Failure posture (ADR-0012 §1) ──
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — `std::nullopt` on a pool/query degrade (logged),
///     never a silent empty. An empty member list or empty `app_name` is a
///     precondition miss → empty value, not a degrade.
///
/// The percentile floor a small group needs (a named set of specific devices ⇒
/// small-N aggregate = de-facto individual behaviour) is applied by the READ
/// model (`app_perf_group_trend`), not here — this reader just produces the
/// honest aggregate + its device_count.
