/// ADR-2001 §§1,3 — the deprovision-time principal-set resolver and
/// credentials-FIRST revoke orchestrator, shared by every human-deprovision
/// seam: SCIM `active:false` (PATCH/PUT, via the shared `deactivate()`
/// helper), SCIM `DELETE .../Users/{id}`, SCIM create-with-`active:false`
/// (all `scim_routes.cpp`), and the dashboard `DELETE /api/settings/users/
/// {username}` (`settings_routes.cpp`).
///
/// Lives ABOVE `ScimStore`/`ApiTokenStore`/`AuthManager` (the three stores it
/// calls in sequence) — never inside any of them (INV-31-3, one owning store
/// each; this file is orchestration, not storage).
///
/// LOCK/POOL DISCIPLINE (hard invariant, ADR-2001 §3): the three stores share
/// one bounded `pg_pool_`. Every function here calls each store's public
/// method in strict SEQUENCE and never holds one store's pool lease while
/// calling another (a nested second lease from the same pool can exhaust/
/// deadlock it, `api_token_store.hpp:257`). `AuthManager::mu_` stays a leaf,
/// never held across a store/DB call — each iteration below is a bare
/// sequence of independent, self-contained calls with no lock spanning them.
///
/// Explicitly NOT `session_revoke_fn` (`server.cpp:15346`) — that helper is
/// session-FIRST and carries `caller=self|admin` metric semantics that do
/// not apply to a deprovision. This is a distinct orchestrator over the same
/// two underlying primitives (`ApiTokenStore::revoke_for_principal` +
/// `AuthManager::invalidate_user_sessions`), credentials-FIRST per ADR-2001
/// §3.
