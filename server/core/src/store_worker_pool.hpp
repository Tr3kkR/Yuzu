/// #3261 governance hardening - bounded delivery worker pool shared by
/// WebhookStore and OffloadTargetStore. Replaces the prior per-event
/// `std::thread(...).detach()` dispatch, which had two independent defects:
///
///  1. UNBOUNDED THREAD CREATION (governance Gate 4 UP-2): the 10-slot
///     counting semaphore in each store capped concurrent HTTP work, but it
///     was acquired INSIDE the spawned thread, after the thread already
///     existed - a burst of events (e.g. a mass agent-reconnect after a
///     gateway bounce, #1197) could still spawn hundreds of OS threads that
///     all pile up blocked on `acquire()`.
///  2. USE-AFTER-FREE AT SHUTDOWN (governance Gate 2/3, security-guardian +
///     cpp-safety + sre independently convergent): a detached thread
///     captures `this` and, on completion, calls `record_delivery()`, whose
///     first statement locks a member mutex. Nothing joined these threads,
///     so a delivery still in flight when the owning store was destroyed
///     dereferenced freed memory.
///
/// A bounded pool with a FIXED worker count and a BOUNDED queue closes (1):
/// `submit()` never spawns a thread on the caller's stack, and a full queue
/// is a `false` return the caller logs and drops rather than an unbounded
/// spawn. It closes (2) two ways: `quiesce(timeout)` gives the owning store
/// an explicit, BOUNDED wait-for-drain to call before it destroys itself
/// (matching the `web_thread_done_cv_` 15s-grace-then-escalate pattern
/// already established in `ServerImpl::stop()`, `server.cpp`), and as
/// defense in depth the destructor still joins every worker unconditionally
/// - so even a caller that skips `quiesce()` cannot free the pool (and by
/// construction, cannot free a store that OWNS the pool as its last-declared
/// member) while a worker is still touching store state.
///
/// This is deliberately NOT a general-purpose thread pool - no work
/// stealing, no futures, no priority. `agents/core/src/thread_pool.hpp` is
/// the agent-side sibling this borrows its exception-firewall idiom from;
/// they are not shared because the two build targets (agent, server) do not
/// share a common internal library for something this small.
