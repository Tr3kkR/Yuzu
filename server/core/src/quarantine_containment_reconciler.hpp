/// @file quarantine_containment_reconciler.hpp
/// #3425: closes the "quarantined while offline, never re-contained on
/// reconnect" gap. A `QuarantineStore` active record persists across a
/// device going offline and the #881 dispatch gate keeps refusing operator
/// commands to it — containment holds at the control plane — but nothing on
/// the reconnect path re-applies the device's OWN firewall. This component
/// is that "nothing": it re-drives `redispatch_stored_containment`
/// (`quarantine_reapply.hpp`) for every active record whose endpoint
/// containment is not yet confirmed.
///
/// Two triggers, one component (mirrors PreflightRunner + the Guardian
/// heartbeat reconcile, both already in this file's neighborhood):
///   * `tick()` — a background thread calls this on a cadence (server.cpp).
///     `AgentRegistry::send_to` silently drops offline agents, so a tick
///     against a still-offline device costs one cheap skip and naturally
///     catches a device that reconnected since the last tick.
///   * `notify_agent_heartbeat()` — wired via
///     `HeartbeatIngestion::set_quarantine_reconcile_fn` (heartbeat, NOT
///     `AgentServiceImpl::Register` — Register returns before the Subscribe
///     stream exists, so `send_to` would silently drop a dispatch fired from
///     there). Fast path is one mutex-guarded lookup in a cache `tick()`
///     refreshes; a miss (the overwhelming majority of heartbeats, from
///     agents with no active record) costs nothing — no store read on the
///     hot path, and NOTHING on the registration path at all (acceptance
///     criterion).
///
/// Confirmation is a FOLLOW-UP `quarantine.status` read, never inferred from
/// `agents_reached > 0` (dispatch acceptance is not proof of endpoint
/// containment — see `quarantine_reapply.hpp`). A previously-CONFIRMED
/// agent re-verifies on EITHER of two independent churn signals, checked
/// separately every tick (governance re-review, Findings UP-1/UP-2):
///   * SESSION churn — live `AgentSession::session_id` no longer matches
///     `confirmed_session_id` (a reboot, a service restart — the firewall
///     rules from before the restart are gone). Re-verifies via STATUS
///     first, never a blind re-apply, so a genuinely-still-contained
///     reconnect doesn't needlessly contend with the agent-side mutation
///     gate for no reason.
///   * RECORD churn — the active row's id no longer matches
///     `confirmed_record_id` (released, then requarantined — possibly with
///     a different whitelist — while the agent stayed connected on the same
///     session, so session churn alone would never have caught it). A
///     status re-check would prove nothing about whether the NEW record's
///     whitelist was ever applied, so this resets straight to the fresh
///     apply path instead of routing through the status-first recheck.
/// A confirm is additionally checked against the session that was live when
/// the verifying STATUS dispatch was actually SENT (`pending_session_id`),
/// not just the session live at confirm time — closes a narrow reboot
/// window between dispatch and confirm that would otherwise attribute a
/// stale session's status read to a new one.
///
/// State: durable across restarts via `QuarantineStore::mark_endpoint_applied`/
/// `mark_endpoint_confirmed` (schema v2); in-memory (this class) for
/// per-agent phase/in-flight-command/backoff/confirmed-session bookkeeping —
/// lost on restart. A restart therefore costs one full apply-then-verify
/// cycle per previously-confirmed active record, NOT merely a redundant
/// verify: a fresh `AgentState` defaults `confirmed=false`, so the record
/// re-enters via the normal apply path, not the cheaper `verify_first`
/// status-only path (`last_confirmed_at != 0` is available in the store for
/// a future caller that wants to skip straight to a status-only verify on
/// restart; this component does not read it back today, so it does not).
///
/// Concurrency: `tick()` and `notify_agent_heartbeat()` both funnel into
/// `reconcile_one()`, which claims a per-agent rate-limit slot UNDER THE
/// LOCK before any I/O (the Guardian heartbeat reconcile's claim-then-act
/// shape) — a concurrent tick and heartbeat for the same agent cannot both
/// dispatch. Store reads/dispatch calls never run WHILE the lock is held
/// (PolicyEvaluator's rule — dispatch is blocking gRPC).
///
/// Multi-replica: `reconcile_one`'s reachability check
/// (`AgentRegistry::get_session`) naturally partitions reapply work to
/// whichever replica holds the agent's live Subscribe stream — no
/// cross-replica coordination needed.
///
/// KNOWN RESIDUAL RACE, DISCLOSED NOT SILENTLY ACCEPTED (adversarial review
/// 2026-08-24, Kimi K8 / Codex CDX-P1-01): `redispatch_stored_containment`
/// reads the active row, then dispatches, with no re-validation in between —
/// a concurrent `release_device` can commit inside that window. The dispatch
/// itself cannot be recalled once sent, so a device released at the exact
/// moment the reconciler is mid-apply can end up firewalled with no active
/// `QuarantineStore` record naming it (the store-side bookkeeping now stays
/// honest either way — see the `mark_endpoint_applied`/`mark_endpoint_confirmed`
/// result-checking below — but the already-sent endpoint action is not
/// itself undone). The window is narrow (one synchronous read-then-dispatch
/// pair inside a single `reconcile_one` call, not spanning any of this
/// component's own waiting) and `release_device` is an infrequent, deliberate
/// operator action, so this ships as a disclosed, tracked limitation rather
/// than a merge-blocking defect — the proper fix (a database-backed claim or
/// generation on the active row, checked by both `release_device` and the
/// reapply path) is a real schema/contract change of its own, not a
/// same-round patch. Track as a follow-up before relying on this component
/// as a complete substitute for auditing release-vs-reapply interleavings by
/// hand on a high-value target.
