/// A secret's `value` is OMITTED and replaced by `is_set`, NOT placeholdered: the
/// placeholder is itself a legal value, so a config-as-code or backup-restore client
/// reading it and writing it back would silently set the literal string as the
/// credential. `updated_by`/`updated_at` are kept for both kinds, so an operator can
/// still see that a secret is set and who set it.
///
/// Safe under EITHER input: it omits a secret's value whether it was handed redacted
/// or plaintext entries, so a future caller who wires `get_all_with_secrets()` into
/// it does not leak. That is deliberate -- do not "simplify" it into trusting the
/// caller to have redacted first.
///
/// `is_set` is derived from a non-empty value, which is why `get_all()` leaves an
/// EMPTY secret empty rather than placeholdering it.
