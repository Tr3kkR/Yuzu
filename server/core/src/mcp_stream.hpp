/// MCP Streamable HTTP GET SSE channel (ADR-1005 Decision 15, track 2f PR 2).
///
/// The `GET /mcp/v1/` channel a client attaches to a session it minted on
/// `initialize`. It carries the server→client half of that session: heartbeats,
/// a bounded per-session replay ring for `Last-Event-ID` resume, and (from
/// track 2f PR 3) the `notifications/progress` frames the streamed-POST bridge
/// publishes. In PR 2 nothing produces frames yet — `publish()` is the seam PR 3
/// and the tests write through.
///
/// Invariants this module owns (governance: security-guardian / cpp-safety):
///   * Event ids are PER-SESSION, monotonic from 1, never global (Decision
///     15(j) / CH-3). A restart or re-initialize gets a fresh namespace.
///   * The replay ring is BOUNDED (Decision 15(d)). A cursor whose frames have
///     been evicted is never silently gapped: the caller 404s and the client
///     re-initializes, refetching durable state by `execution_id`.
///   * A live stream re-validates its credential every heartbeat tick and dies
///     within one tick of a revocation (Decision 15(c)); an INDETERMINATE auth
///     backend (a blip, not a revocation) gets a bounded grace window instead of
///     a mass kill (Decision 15(i)).
///   * Concurrency is admission-controlled through the shared
///     `sse_bus::StreamBudget` — one budget across every held-open SSE response
///     on the shared httplib worker pool (Decision 15(h)).
///
/// LOCK ORDER (both classes): `McpStreamState::mu_` → `SseSinkState::mu`.
/// Never the reverse. The pump therefore releases the sink mutex before calling
/// back into `McpStreamState`, and no socket write ever happens under either
/// mutex (a stalled peer must not block a publisher).
