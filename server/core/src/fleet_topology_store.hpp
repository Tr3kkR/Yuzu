/**
 * fleet_topology_store.hpp -- Aggregator + cache for /viz/fleet topology
 *
 * The store turns a vector of per-agent fleet_snapshot.v1 payloads into a
 * single TopologySnapshot, applying:
 *   * Process categorisation (process_category.hpp)
 *   * Cross-machine IP resolution (ip → agent_id map)
 *   * Connection scope classification (Local / InternalFleet / External)
 *   * Optional vulnerability overlay (NvdDatabase::match_inventory)
 *
 * Caching: 60-second TTL keyed by `include_vuln` (LRU-of-2). When a get()
 * call finds the slot cold or expired, exactly one caller refills it; the
 * others wait on the same shared_ptr. Cache and dispatch are decoupled
 * via the `Fetcher` seam -- PR 2 ships this with fake fetchers used by
 * tests; PR 3 will inject the real fetcher that drives the agent dispatch
 * via AgentRegistry::send_to + an agent_service_impl response callback.
 *
 * Thread-safe: a std::shared_mutex guards the slots map; refill runs
 * outside the lock so dispatch latency doesn't block other slot reads.
 *
 * Lifetime: one instance per Server, owned by the daemon for its lifetime.
 * Constructor is called once in server.cpp with the real fetcher injected;
 * never per-request.
