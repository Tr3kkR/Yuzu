/// WS-10 (ADR-2002 §Decomposition item 10): the checked-in, exhaustive
/// classification of EVERY server background pass for replica-safety, so a
/// newly-added pass cannot silently double-run under a second replica.
///
/// THE UNIT IS THE PASS, NOT THE THREAD. One thread multiplexes many passes of
/// different classes — `result_set_maint_thread_` alone runs 11 (the per-replica
/// event-outbox poll, several advisory-locked reaps, gauge refreshes), and
/// `health_recompute_thread_` runs a mix of read-only gauges, a fleet-wide CRL
/// re-publish, and a per-replica stream teardown. Classifying a thread wholesale
/// would falsely certify an unsafe pass riding a mostly-safe thread. Each entry
/// below is one unit of work.
///
/// THREE CLASSES (ADR-2002 item 10):
///   - ReplicaSafe          — correct to run on every replica concurrently,
///                            because it is read-only/local, idempotent, an
///                            execute-once CAS, or an advisory-lock SINGLE-WRITER
///                            retention pass. MUST-run-per-replica passes (the
///                            event-outbox poll, ADR-2002 §5) are ReplicaSafe and
///                            must NEVER be leader-gated.
///   - FencedLeaderOnly     — side-effecting singleton work that double-fires
///                            across replicas (agent dispatch, CRL numbering).
///                            Runs only on the WS-3 fenced leader; ENFORCEMENT is
///                            slice 10.3 (rides WS-3 3.2), not this file. ADDING a
///                            FencedLeaderOnly pass REQUIRES wrapping its dispatch
///                            site with `leader_gate_permits<background_job_class(
///                            "<pass>")>(leader_elector_.get())` (leader_gate.hpp) —
///                            the consteval class lookup pins the CLASS but not gate
///                            PRESENCE, so a new row without a gate site compiles and
///                            double-fires (adversarial review K5; CI sweep #4121).
///   - DisabledUntilFixed   — not yet replica-safe and not yet leader-gated; must
///                            not run per-replica until its named fix lands.
///
/// HOW CLASSIFICATION IS ENFORCED — and the honest limit of it. This array is the
/// single compile-time source of truth (git-auditable, CI-compiled), and
/// `tests/unit/server/test_background_jobs.cpp` pins its internal consistency +
/// completeness against the audited inventory (a count tripwire). Every
/// CATASTROPHIC-CLASS site carries `YUZU_ASSERT_BACKGROUND_JOB(...)` — a consteval
/// lookup that makes removing/renaming its table entry a BUILD FAILURE (the
/// `command_capability.hpp` ExecuteGate precedent): all FencedLeaderOnly and
/// DisabledUntilFixed passes (schedule/policy/quarantine dispatch, ca.publish_crl,
/// nvd_sync, the concurrency reconciler), plus the load-bearing ReplicaSafe ones —
/// the event-outbox poll, the three retention prunes, the app_perf rollup upsert,
/// and the MUST-run-per-replica / shared-PG-writing passes found by the sweep
/// (cert reloader, catalogue rollup, provisional-MFA cleanup, OTA watchdog, MCP
/// projector, MCP bridge sweep + session gc, store-worker delivery pools). This
/// proves named⇒classified for those sites. It does NOT yet prove pass⇒named for
/// every dispatch site — a consteval sweep visiting ALL of them is a tracked
/// follow-up (#4094) — so completeness rests on THIS array plus the recorded
/// sweep methodology below and the routed-concern review
/// (cpp-safety+sre+compliance-officer on any new background pass). A new
/// side-effecting pass is a diff against THIS array, never a silent addition.
///
/// SWEEP METHODOLOGY (how this array was made exhaustive — repeat it on any audit).
/// Over `server/core/` + `common/include/yuzu/`, grep for: `std::thread` /
/// `std::jthread` / `*_thread_` members / `.detach()` (thread-start sites);
/// `while (`/`for (;;)` bodies containing `sleep_for` / `wait_for` / a
/// condition-variable wait (periodic loops); and the verbs `run_loop` / `sweep` /
/// `tick` / `reap` / `cleanup` / `refresh` / `drain` / `recompute` / `poll` /
/// `reconcile` / `sync` / `watchdog`. For each hit decide: per-request handler
/// (OUT — rides the caller's thread, e.g. the detached gateway-forward, the lazy
/// FleetTopologyStore refill, per-request SSE waits) or a standing background pass
/// (IN — gets a row here). The 2026-09-07 sweep added 8 passes an earlier revision
/// missed (cert reloader, catalogue rollup, provisional-MFA cleanup, OTA watchdog,
/// MCP projector, MCP bridge sweep, MCP session gc, store-worker delivery pools);
/// deliberately-excluded non-passes (documented so the next audit does not re-flag
/// them): the detached per-dispatch gateway-forward thread, FleetTopologyStore's
/// request-path refill, ExecutionEventBus inline gc, `shutdown_watcher.hpp`'s
/// signal self-pipe watcher, per-request SSE `wait_for` loops, and boot-time
/// one-shot poll loops (`default_certs.cpp`, `nvd_client.cpp`).
