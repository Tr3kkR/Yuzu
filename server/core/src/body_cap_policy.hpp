/// @file body_cap_policy.hpp
/// The ONE table deciding the pre-auth request-body byte cap per route class
/// (#2407).
///
/// THE DEFECT: an unauthenticated caller can make the server buffer up to
/// httplib's 100 MiB default (`CPPHTTPLIB_PAYLOAD_MAX_LENGTH`, httplib.h:130)
/// on every route except `/mcp/`, which `server.cpp`'s pre-routing handler
/// already caps at 4 MiB (#2437, `mcp_body_exceeds_cap`/`mcp_body_unmeasurable`
/// in `web_utils.hpp`). This header generalizes that per-path cap into one
/// table so every other route family gets a bound sized to what it actually
/// needs, instead of either httplib's 100 MiB backstop everywhere (too loose)
/// or one global 4 MiB cap (too tight — it would break the ~70 MiB live-query
/// bundle route outright).
///
/// THE RULE, stated once: the cap is enforced in `server.cpp`'s pre-routing
/// handler, the SAME chokepoint the existing `/mcp/` cap already runs from —
/// NEVER inside a route handler. httplib invokes the pre-routing handler
/// BEFORE it reads the request body (httplib.h: `routing()` calls the
/// pre-routing handler, then `read_content()`, in that order), so a rejection
/// returned from there costs a header parse and never buffers the oversized
/// payload. Enforcing the same bound inside a handler is too late — by the
/// time a handler runs, httplib has already buffered the body up to its own
/// 100 MiB backstop. This header is deliberately NOT a
/// `Server::set_payload_max_length` call: that knob is server-global and
/// would also squeeze the certificate-chain upload and content-distribution
/// staging on the same httplib instance — the issue text proposes it and it
/// is deliberately rejected here.
///
/// EXTEND this table, never fork it — a second cap list is exactly the kind
/// of drift `authz_topology_floor.hpp` and `dispatch_confined_arms.hpp` exist
/// to prevent for their own chokepoints.
///
/// MATCHING: the key is `{method, segment-boundary path prefix}`, NOT path
/// alone. Path-only matching is insufficient — the real route table carries
/// method-specific AND regex registrations on the very same literal prefix
/// (e.g. `rest_api_v1.cpp:7759`'s `POST /api/v1/guaranteed-state/rules` vs
/// `:7904`'s regex `PUT /api/v1/guaranteed-state/rules/{id}`), so a
/// path-only cap could not tell a bulk-create request from a single-rule
/// update even if they warranted different bounds. Matching is on SEGMENT
/// BOUNDARIES: `/api/v1/bundlesevil` must NOT match the `/api/v1/bundles`
/// entry (`body_cap_prefix_matches` requires the byte immediately after the
/// prefix to be `/`, or the prefix to already end in `/`, or an exact-length
/// match). Longest match wins, so a narrow, more specific entry (e.g.
/// `/scim/v2/`) always beats the always-matching catch-all default. There is
/// an explicit catch-all default entry (empty prefix, matches every method)
/// so `resolve_body_cap` never has "no answer" for an unlisted route.
///
/// `requires_measurable` decides whether a body this server cannot size in
/// advance — chunked `Transfer-Encoding`, or POST/PUT/PATCH with no
/// `Content-Length` — is REFUSED outright rather than admitted up to the
/// cap. Chunked request bodies are legal HTTP, and this repo does not
/// control every client that will ever talk to these routes, so the bit
/// DEFAULTS OFF and is opted into per class, not per table. It is ON only
/// for `/mcp/`: that surface's own protocol/client contract already requires
/// `Content-Length` on every framed body (see `web_utils.hpp:577`'s
/// `mcp_body_unmeasurable` rationale), so refusing an unmeasurable MCP body
/// costs a conforming client nothing. Every other class below — public REST
/// (bundles), SCIM, certificate import (REST + dashboard), the plugin trust
/// bundle, product-pack/workflow authoring, and the OTA upload — keeps it
/// OFF and falls back to httplib's 100 MiB backstop for a body it cannot
/// size, until a Content-Length contract is documented and a representative
/// client population is tested against it. That is a scoping decision for
/// THIS change, not a claim those routes are safe unmeasured forever.
///
/// KNOWN LIMITATION, recorded deliberately, not implied away: because of the
/// default above, a chunked or Content-Length-less body is NOT refused BEFORE
/// BEING READ on any class but `/mcp/` — this table's pre-routing chokepoint
/// admits it, up to httplib's own 100 MiB backstop, without checking this
/// table's cap at all. A comment or doc that says chunked bodies are
/// "refused" without naming `/mcp/` as the sole PRE-READ exception is wrong.
/// This is a recorded adjudication, not an oversight — see the paragraph
/// above for why — kept in sync with `docs/user-manual/rest-api.md` "Pre-Auth
/// Request Body Caps".
///
/// That gap is narrower than it once was: `server.cpp`'s `set_pre_request_
/// handler` (body-cap-post-read-stage) is a SECOND chokepoint, driven by the
/// SAME `resolve_body_cap` table, that runs after httplib has read the body
/// into `req.body` but before the route handler runs — so a chunked body
/// that turns out to be over this table's cap is still refused, just after
/// being buffered rather than before. It closes "reaches a handler
/// uncapped", not "gets buffered uncapped" — see that handler's own doc
/// comment for what it does and does not cover (notably: it cannot see a
/// multipart request's body at all, since httplib never copies multipart
/// content into `req.body`).
///
///
/// ROUTED-CONCERN ROW: `.claude/routed-concerns-access-control.md`, which
/// routes any change to this table or to `server.cpp`'s pre-routing cap
/// branch to `security-guardian` + `architect` + `cpp-safety`. That routing
/// is the row's ONLY job and nothing else performs it — this header, the
/// user docs and the tests all DESCRIBE the invariants, but none of them
/// puts a reviewer in front of a future change. Keep the row and this header
/// in step; if they ever disagree, the row governs, because it is what a
/// reviewer is actually handed.
///
/// (The row lives in the access-control file rather than the main table
/// because `.claude/routed-concerns.md` hit CLAUDE.md's 40k-character
/// ceiling and was split along that axis to make room — the same ceiling
/// that once split the table out of CLAUDE.md itself. This chokepoint sits
/// beside `authz_topology_floor` and `dispatch_target_shape` there, which is
/// where it belongs: same family, same failure mode.)
///
/// The numbers below are grounded in the cited call sites, not invented —
/// but "grounded" is not "measured byte-for-byte": two different kinds of
/// reasoning appear beside the exact matches, and BOTH are reasoned rather
/// than measured. (1) MEASURED-PLUS-MARGIN (`ca_import_chain_dashboard`,
/// `plugin_trust_bundle`, `tar_dashboard_sql`, `tar_result_set_sql`,
/// `instruction_yaml`): a real handler-level check exists and is cited, but
/// the pre-routing gate checks the RAW body while the handler checks a
/// DECODED/PARSED value (form-decoded, JSON-unescaped, or multipart-
/// extracted), so the cap adds an explicit margin over the handler's own
/// number instead of mirroring it — getting this wrong rejects legitimate
/// traffic, which is exactly what happened to the two TAR entries before
/// this fix (see their comments). (2) JUDGMENT CALL, NO CONTRACT
/// (`guardian_rule_authoring`, `workflow_yaml`, `product_pack_yaml`,
/// `instruction_import`, `nvd_match`): no aggregate size contract is defined
/// anywhere in the codebase for what these accept — arbitrary YAML/legacy
/// `yaml_source` bodies for the first three, an unbounded `responseTemplates`
/// array for `instruction_import`, an unbounded software-inventory array for
/// `nvd_match` — so each cap is an explicit, ADMITTEDLY-JUDGMENT-CALL bound
/// reasoned against that class's OWN realistic scale (not copy-pasted from a
/// sibling), rather than a squeeze. That is TEN of the table's entries
/// reasoned rather than exactly measured — do not tighten any of them
/// without a real contract to measure against, and do not read their
/// presence as license to guess a number for any OTHER class; every other
/// entry below mirrors a cited, decoded-equals-raw byte count exactly. A
/// THIRD, distinct category — `ota_upload` and `json_to_csv_export` — is
/// pinned at httplib's own 100 MiB backstop rather than squeezed OR given a
/// judgment-call MiB number: both carry content whose legitimate size is a
/// direct function of something this table cannot bound (an installer
/// binary's real size; an export's size following directly from the
/// operator's own prior query), so there is no smaller number to reason
/// toward — the entry's only job is making that an explicit, reviewed
