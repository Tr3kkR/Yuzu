// is otherwise by canonical OS token: BOTH sides are normalised (`normalize_os` —
// lower-cased and darwin mapped to macos) and then compared for EQUALITY, so a
// short/ambiguous target like "win" can never spuriously match "darwin" (a raw
// substring test would admit it). NOTE: `agent_os` is always the RAW kAgentOs
// token ("windows" | "linux" | "darwin"), never verbose free text —
// `normalize_os` does NOT parse a string like "Windows 11 Pro" down to
// "windows"; it only lower-cases and maps darwin to macos. An earlier version

//   unknown / missing / non-string  -> falls back to the Windows-only rule,
//   spark_type                         so a malformed row or a guard type

// The server must therefore report an unsupported (agent, rule) pair as "not
// yet implemented" rather than letting it fold into the offline "unknown"
// bucket and read as armed — an operator must never mistake a no-op platform
// for a protected one. Just as important, a caller MUST first check whether
// the pair already owns a REAL status row before treating "unsupported" as
// "the agent never reported" — Linux Service now legitimately reports real
// status, so skipping that check double-counts the pair (the #4252 bug); see
// the shared exclusion predicate in guardian_routes.cpp. `agent_os` is the RAW
// token the agent reports (kAgentOs: "windows" | "linux" | "darwin"); it is
// normalised before comparison. An empty `agent_os` (unknown — disconnect
// race / partial registration) returns true so we never mislabel it
// unimplemented, for any spark_type. THIS is the single place to extend as
// more guard types/platforms gain support.

// Per-rule, LRU-bounded, time-based log-rate sampler for the depth-guard
// exclusion path (#4497/#4499 - replaces the single shared count+episode
// sampler #4478 originally shipped). One process-wide instance is still
// shared by every push call site in this process (same posture as before),
// but state is now keyed by rule_id instead of being one global clock, so a
// persistently-poisoned rule can no longer mask, or reset, a DIFFERENT
// poisoned rule's own log cadence - the #4497 "cross-rule masking" defect.
//
// THE RECORDED DESIGN DECISION (#4497 acceptance criterion 1 - an external
// architecture consultation was run on this question; this is the outcome,
// not one option among several):
//
//   - A rule_id absent from the cache logs immediately, then enters the
//     cache.
//   - A cached rule_id logs again only once at least kRepeatInterval has
//     elapsed since its LAST PERMITTED log (steady_clock, so a wall-clock
//     step/NTP correction cannot affect it), regardless of how many
//     intervening exclusions for it were suppressed. Measuring time since
//     the last EXCLUSION instead (rather than the last permitted log) would
//     let continuous traffic on one rule suppress its own reminders
//     indefinitely - deliberately not done.
//   - Every exclusion (permitted or suppressed) refreshes that rule_id's LRU
//     recency; only a PERMITTED exclusion advances its logging deadline.
//   - Inserting a rule_id beyond kCapacity evicts the least-recently-OBSERVED
//     entry, NOT the least-recently-PERMITTED-TO-LOG one - the two differ in
//     general: every observation, permitted or not, splices an entry to the
//     front, so a rule under continuous exclusion pressure normally stays
//     "hot" even while its own log line stays silenced by kRepeatInterval.
//     It is evicted only when it is the least-recently-observed entry AT THE
//     MOMENT a new distinct rule_id is inserted into a full cache - i.e. when
//     kCapacity distinct OTHER rule_ids intervene between two of its own
//     observations. That precondition is rare in normal operation but is
//     exactly what happens, on every pass, in limitation (1) below.
//     An evicted rule_id subsequently encountered is therefore treated as a
//     fresh first-observation and logs immediately again.
//   - This deliberately fixes #4497's OTHER symptom too (throughput-scaling
//     log volume): a single persistently-poisoned rule now logs at most once
//     per kRepeatInterval, full stop, independent of how often the push
//     fan-out reconciles it.
//
// ACCEPTED, DOCUMENTED LIMITATION (do not "fix" this silently - it is a
// tradeoff, not a gap): a 256-entry LRU is bounded PER-RULE pacing, not a
// GLOBAL log-rate limit. Two cases are explicitly out of scope:
//   (1) a stable set of MORE than kCapacity distinct poisoned rules cycling
//       through the cache IN A REPEATING ORDER is a HARD CLIFF, not a mild
//       leak: at exactly kCapacity+1 such rules, every rule is evicted right
//       before its own next turn in the SAME pass that re-admits it, so
//       EVERY rule logs on EVERY pass - a 0% suppression rate, not merely
//       "somewhat more often than once per kRepeatInterval". Verified
//       directly against this class (see test_guardian_push_builder.cpp's
//       kCapacity+1 cliff test: 257 rule_ids, 5 consecutive passes, 257/257
//       logged every pass). This is worse in this one regime than the
//       pre-#4497 shared sampler's 1-in-100 log floor, and is an accepted
//       design tradeoff (a per-rule backstop for this regime was out of
//       scope for #4497/#4499) rather than a defect in this class;
//   (2) a simultaneous first-observation burst across many distinct rules
//       (all new to the cache at once) is unbounded - every one of them logs
//       immediately, by design (the point of per-rule keying is that a FIRST
//       observation is never suppressed).
// See docs/user-manual/guaranteed-state.md's yuzu_guardian_push_rule_excluded_total
// entry for the operator-facing version of this same tradeoff.
//
// Unlike RuntimeConfigStore's note_read_degrade (docs/observability-conventions.md),
// this deliberately does NOT also take a MetricsRegistry* and increment a
// counter itself: the counter has its own always-fires condition (every
// exclusion, not just permitted-to-log ones), so the caller increments it
// separately, unconditionally, right before calling should_log() - a reader
// porting this pattern elsewhere should not assume the two responsibilities
// are bundled the way they are in that precedent. The metric's `reason` label
// stays the only label: rule_id is deliberately never added to it (an open,
// unbounded set would reopen the exact cardinality problem this in-process
// map is scoped to avoid - the map's keys never leave this process).
//
// Independently instantiable (default-constructible + set_clock_for_test) so
// tests exercise it directly with deterministic injected timestamps, never a
// singleton the tests must reset; the process-wide instance used by
// build_agent_push lives in guardian_push_builder.cpp's anonymous namespace.
