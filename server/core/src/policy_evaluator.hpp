/// @file policy_evaluator.hpp
/// Drives the compliance CHECK -> VERDICT pipeline that was previously dead.
///
/// Authored policies bind a fragment (a check instruction + a CEL
/// `check_compliance` expression) to a scope. Nothing used to evaluate them:
/// `PolicyStore::update_agent_status` (the only writer of compliance status)
/// had no caller and no trigger fired, so `get_fleet_compliance` always read
/// 0%. This component closes that gap.
///
/// Model (two-phase, async): a background thread `tick()`s on a cadence.
///   * dispatch_due(): claims due policies via `PolicyStore::claim_due_policies`
///     (ADR-0056 — a durable, fleet-wide single-sweeper claim; see that store's
///     header for why due-ness can no longer live in this class's own
///     memory), resolves scope -> agents, dispatches the fragment's
///     check_instruction with a generated execution_id, and records an
///     in-flight check.
///   * collect_ready(): for in-flight checks past a grace window (or once all
///     targets have responded), read each agent's result via
///     ResponseStore::query_by_execution, evaluate the CEL against the parsed
///     result fields, and write compliant / non_compliant / unknown / error
///     via PolicyStore::update_agent_status (one row per agent). Stays
///     per-replica and in-memory: only the replica that dispatched a check
///     ever holds its in-flight entry, so there is nothing to coordinate here
///     — `update_agent_status`'s UPSERT is naturally idempotent against a
///     racing manual evaluate_now()/remediate() call on another replica FOR
///     THE STATUS VALUE (each write converges to a consistent final row).
///
/// Remediation is MANUAL and opt-in (operator-gated) and only available when
/// the fragment defines a fix_instruction: `remediate()` marks targets
/// `fixing`, dispatches the fix, then (on a later tick) dispatches the
/// post-check / check instruction and writes the true post-fix verdict. There
/// is no automatic non_compliant -> fix loop.
///
/// HA WS-3 3.4 (ADR-2002 §6 finding 6a): a concurrent `remediate()` call for
/// the same policy is arbitrated by a DURABLE, per-(policy,agent) CAS in
/// `PolicyStore` (`claim_remediation`/`release_remediation_claim`) — CLAIM,
/// then DISPATCH, then mark 'fixing' only for the subset the dispatch
/// actually DELIVERED to. This closes what the pre-HA in-process
/// `remediating_` guard never covered: a sibling replica's independent
/// remediate() call for the same policy had no shared state to see it and
/// would double-dispatch the fix, double-incrementing
/// `update_agent_status`'s `fix_attempt_count` on a fix instruction that may
/// not be idempotent. The claim is released (a) for a claimed-but-NOT-
/// delivered target (offline / quarantined / plugin-absent / a systemic
/// containment-gate failure) immediately, WITHOUT burning a retry attempt;
/// (b) for a delivered target once its FixWait entry matures in
/// `collect_ready()`; (c) by `claim_due_policies`'s own stranded-`fixing`
/// staleness sweep, using the SAME `fixing_stale_seconds` window, if the
/// claiming replica dies mid-flight (superseding the old unconditional
/// every-restart reset this class's constructor used to do, which would
/// stomp another replica's still-live remediation under N replicas).
