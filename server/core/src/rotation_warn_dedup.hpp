// Rotation successor-unused warning: which signals fire on THIS tick.
//
// The rotation sweep re-observes the same stuck pair every tick (60s), and the
// three signals it can emit do NOT share a cadence. Keeping that decision here
// rather than inline in the sweep driver is what makes it testable at all —
// the driver lives in a thread lambda inside `ServerImpl` and has never had a
// test, which is how an un-throttled audit write reached review.
//
// The cadences, and why each is what it is:
//
//   * LOG          — every tick once the window has ELAPSED. That pair is a
//                    live, indefinite condition an operator greps for, and
//                    logs rotate, so repetition is free. Nothing is logged
//                    before the window elapses: the pair is still on schedule.
//   * COUNT + AUDIT — ONCE per pair per state, and they share that cadence
//                     DELIBERATELY. The audit row is the SOC 2 evidence, and
//                     evidence records that the decline HAPPENED, not how many
//                     times it was re-observed: at a 60s tick an un-throttled
//                     row is ~1440/day for ONE stuck pair, written into a
//                     store whose retention pass caps at 25 000 deletions, so
//                     a few indefinitely-stuck pairs would outpace real
//                     operator activity and push genuine evidence out of the
//                     window. The counter is held to the same cadence so the
//                     series keeps ONE meaning — an event count. Making it
//                     per-tick would turn the same series into a rate for
//                     elapsed pairs and leave it an event count for
//                     pre-elapse ones, which no alert can read.
//
// That leaves a persistently-stuck pair with no alertable RATE — only a log
// line. That gap is real and pre-existing (issue #2964: no rotation failure
// mode is alertable today), and closing it belongs there, as a deliberate new
// signal reviewed by `sre`, not as a silent semantic change to an existing
// counter made in passing by an audit-volume fix.
//
// PRE-ELAPSE and ELAPSED are tracked SEPARATELY and deliberately not folded
// into one set. The elapsed branch must bypass the pre-elapse de-dup (that is
// the whole point of warning past the window), so a shared set would either
// make the elapsed audit inherit the de-dup it exists to skip, or silence the
// lead-time warning once the pair elapsed. Two states, two sets.
//
// PROCESS-LOCAL, by the same precedent as `ApiTokenStore`'s rotation grace
// cache: a restart forfeits the state and re-emits once. That is correct
// rather than merely tolerable — the new process holds no record that it ever
// declined, so a fresh evidence row is the honest output. It does mean N
// replicas emit N times; the rotation consent record has the same property and
// is tracked as issue #2961.
