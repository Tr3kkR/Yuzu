/// @file plugin_action_catalogue_execution_artifacts.hpp
/// One fragment of the command capability catalogue: `execution_artifacts`'s
/// three actions (`agents/plugins/execution_artifacts/src/
/// execution_artifacts_plugin.cpp`). Classified by READING the
/// implementation, per this package's spec.
///
/// All three actions (`shimcache`, `amcache`, `prefetch`) are ReadOnly/None —
/// the plugin only ever reads a registry value, a private hive copy, or a
/// prefetch file and never mutates host state on any platform; the data
/// bytes of any artefact are never emitted (paths and hashes only).
///
/// Grouped under the same `Forensics` securable P0 seeds and
/// `plugin_action_catalogue_app_usage.hpp` (P22) already uses — the string
/// MUST equal P0's seed literal byte-for-byte (server/core/src/
/// rbac_store.cpp's `seed_defaults()` `types[]`; validated at wave-1
/// integration by test_capability_catalogue's `kSeededSecurableTypes`
/// check, which runs after P0 lands).
///
/// `execution_artifacts` and `app_usage` share the same ENFORCED authorization
/// boundary: both authorize as `Forensics:Read` with `ExecuteGate::AdminOrApproval`,
/// and `Forensics` is seeded to Administrator only. `authz::RiskTier::High`
/// here (vs app_usage's `Medium`) is operator-triage metadata, not a wider
/// authorization gap — it does not gate who can dispatch either plugin. The
/// higher tier reflects that ShimCache/Amcache/Prefetch name real executable
/// paths, cryptographic hashes, and precise run timestamps for a SINGLE named
/// machine — the kind of evidence an incident responder pulls during an
/// active investigation, and exactly the kind of read a rogue or compromised
/// operator identity could otherwise use to fingerprint a target's activity
/// undetected. Single-target, audited, and Administrator-gated dispatch
/// semantics are enforced at the server dispatch layer
/// (server/core/src/dispatch_destructive_gate.hpp, P0's
/// `kForensicsSecurable`/`requires_explicit_targets`) — this fragment only
/// carries the per-action classification that layer keys on. See
/// docs/user-manual/execution-artifacts.md (BR2-004) for the corrected
/// role-boundary statement this comment mirrors.
