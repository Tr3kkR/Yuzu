/// One body for BOTH approval-store failure sites on the MCP recall path: the
/// ticket lookup (rung 1) and the consume (rung 2). They were written
/// separately at first and said different things about the same condition.
///
/// `ConsumeFailure::kStoreError` (and the equivalent `get_checked` failure at
/// rung 1) has producers that are TRANSIENT (a busy or erroring SQLite step,
/// which a retry clears) and producers that are PERMANENT for the life of the
/// process (the store never opened). Answering the permanent case with "retry
/// this call unchanged" is an unbounded loop, and every attempt also writes
/// an audit row, so a degraded approval store turns into an audit-write loop
/// on the substrate already failing to serve it.
///
/// Permanent has TWO independent discriminators — either alone classifies the
/// failure permanent: `!mgr.is_open()` (a null handle does not recover
/// without an operator restarting the server), or
/// `is_permanent_sqlite_error(extended_errcode)` (an OPEN handle whose reads
/// fail permanently — CORRUPT, NOTADB, READONLY, FULL; #2786 "PR 1c"). The
/// caller passes `extended_errcode` rather than this function defaulting it,
/// so a call site cannot silently omit the discriminator and reintroduce the
/// gap the second arm closes.
///
/// The transient arm carries a concrete `retry_after_ms` because invariant A5
/// requires a retry directive to be machine-readable rather than prose. The
/// permanent arm omits the argument, so `a4_error`'s default (-1) applies and
/// the envelope serialises `retry_after_ms` as JSON null, this file's own
/// encoding for "not retryable".
///
/// Lives in a header, not an anonymous namespace, because the branch it
/// replaces had ZERO test coverage in either direction: a governance reviewer
/// deleted the whole thing once and no assertion moved. Unreachable code is
/// untested code.
///
/// `a4_error` is passed in rather than called directly so the caller's
/// correlation-id minting and envelope shape stay in one place, and so a test
/// can observe the arguments without parsing JSON. The constraint below names
/// both call shapes `a4_error` actually has (three-argument and
/// four-argument with a `long` retry hint); a caller satisfying only one
/// arity fails at this declaration with a readable message instead of deep
/// inside template instantiation.
