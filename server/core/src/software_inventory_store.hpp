/// @file software_inventory_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres typed inventory projection (ADR-0016, schema
/// `software_inventory_store`). The read-optimized home for the daily-sync
/// framework's `installed_software` source — normalized rows so fleet-wide
/// queries ("which devices run X < v") are first-class and the schema ports off
/// Postgres easily.
///
/// COEXISTS with the generic per-source `InventoryStore` (the sync framework's
/// baseline blob store, which also backs the scope-walking `kInventoryQuery`
/// source + the eval engine). This class is NOT a replacement — it is the typed
/// projection for the one source that needs structured fleet queries today.
/// Future high-query sources get their own typed table in this same store.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008/0012): holds a `pg::PgPool&`, migrates at
/// construction on a pinned lease, schema-qualifies every runtime statement,
/// uses `RETURNING`. Normalized rows only — NO JSONB/GIN. Failure posture splits by
/// axis (ADR-0012 §1 + ADR-0016 §7) — unlike `OfflineEndpointStore` there is NO
/// in-memory authoritative read layer; this store IS the only server-side read
/// representation of installed software, so it is NOT durability-on-top for reads:
///   - **Data:** a projection — the agent + weekly full-floor are the source of truth.
///   - **Ingest:** fail-soft — a transient PG outage returns kError + nacks; the next
///     sync + the floor self-heal (the agent re-pushes). A blip degrades durability,
///     never correctness.
///   - **Reads:** AUTHORITATIVE — a store/pool/query failure returns `std::nullopt`
///     (logged at warn), NEVER a silent empty. A silent-empty read on a fleet vuln
///     query ("which devices run <CVE>") reads as "installed nowhere" — the fail-open
///     A4 violation ADR-0016 §7 forbids ("surface errors, never silent-empty").
///     `nullopt` = degraded (could not read); an empty *value* = a genuine zero-row
///     result. Staleness is acceptable (return the last projection); failure-as-empty
///     is not.
