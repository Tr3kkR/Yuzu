/// recurred twice on the sibling #1634 workstream before landing here once.

/// None of these functions perform I/O; they operate on already-fetched
/// `Execution`/`AgentExecStatus` rows and an `authz::VisibleSet`. Callers
/// are responsible for fetching those rows via the tracker's `_checked`
/// accessors and failing closed (503) on a degraded read BEFORE calling
/// into this header — these functions have no way to distinguish "no rows"
/// from "read failed" and must not be asked to.
