/// @file gateway_mgmt_stub_pool.hpp
/// HA WS-4 "rest of 4.3" — cross-cluster gateway fan-out. Three independent
/// pieces:
///
///   - `parse_gateway_cluster_addrs`: pure parser for `--gateway-cluster-addr`
///     CLI entries (`cluster_id=host:port`), called from main.cpp BEFORE
///     `Server::create()` so a malformed entry is a CLI exit, not a lenient
///     boot-time warning (this is a routing-correctness input, unlike
///     `trusted_nat_cidrs`' own lenient-parse precedent).
///   - `GatewayMgmtStubPool`: an EAGER, immutable map of
///     `ManagementService::Stub`s, one per configured gateway cluster, built
///     once at server construction (`server.cpp`, alongside the pre-4.3
///     single `gw_mgmt_stub_`/`gw_mgmt_channel_` construction it replaces).
///     `grpc::CreateChannel` is itself lazy-connecting, so eager construction
///     of every configured channel/stub costs nothing and needs no lock on
///     the dispatch hot path (`ServerImpl::forward_gateway_pending`).
///   - `classify_gateway_forward_response`: pure classification of one
///     `SendCommandResponse` read off a forwarding stream, extracted out of
///     `forward_gateway_pending`'s detached-thread lambda (quality-engineer
///     Gate 3 finding) so the agent-id mismatch guard and the `not_connected`
///     synthetic-failure detection are unit-testable without a live gRPC
///     connection — no fake `ManagementService` harness exists in this
///     codebase, and this is the cheap seam that avoids needing one for
///     these two decisions specifically.
///
/// Design per the 4.3 plan's Fable pre-implementation review:
///   - Resolution is TWO-MODE, not a uniform "empty means default, non-empty
///     unmapped means drop" rule — the latter is a BREAKING CHANGE on
///     upgrade, since every existing gateway build announces a non-empty
///     `cluster_id` (`YUZU_GW_CLUSTER_ID`, defaulting to the literal
///     `"default"` when unset — `yuzu_gw_upstream.erl`), not an empty
///     string. Single-cluster mode (no `--gateway-cluster-addr` configured)
///     therefore ignores whatever `cluster_id` a command carries entirely
///     and always resolves to the one legacy `gateway_command_address` stub
///     — byte-for-byte today's pre-4.3 behavior. Multi-cluster mode (the
///     flag IS configured) auto-aliases the key `"default"` to
///     `gateway_command_address` (if set and not already an explicit key)
///     so the gateway's implicit id is modeled, and only then does an
///     unmapped non-empty `cluster_id` become a real config defect.
///   - The resolved LABEL (for the `yuzu_server_gateway_forward_total`
///     metric's `cluster_id` label) is always the matched config key or the
///     fixed literal `"unknown"` — never the raw gateway-asserted wire
///     string, even after ingest clamping (`gateway_service_impl.cpp`'s
///     `kMaxClusterIdLen`) — an attacker-influenced value is still a
///     cardinality risk as a metric label, however bounded in length.
///
/// TRUST BOUNDARY (unhappy-path Gate 4 finding UP-7): `--gateway-cluster-addr`
/// is fully operator-trusted config, like every other CLI flag. Nothing here
/// (or in `forward_gateway_pending`) verifies that the `host:port` configured
/// for a given `cluster_id` is actually THAT cluster — mTLS via the shared
/// credentials authenticates core's OWN identity to whatever peer answers at
/// that address, it does not authenticate the peer's identity back to core
/// (that's the gateway-side #1422 mgmt-plane peer pin, a different
/// direction). A stale/wrong DNS entry or a copy-paste error in the flag
/// value silently dials the wrong cluster with no detectable signal beyond
/// whatever that peer's own behavior reveals. This is the same trust
/// assumption every other operator-authored infra config in this codebase
/// carries — named explicitly here because it's easy to misread the mTLS
/// dial as a verification it isn't.
///
/// PARTIAL TRUST-ZONE BOUNDARY (#4669, CLOSED via mitigation 1 — agent<->cluster
/// affinity in `GatewayRouteStore`; post-governance Fable review originally flagged
/// this as NOT a trust-zone boundary at all, pre-push). `classify_gateway_forward_
/// response`'s agent-id mismatch check (below) still only catches a response naming
/// a DIFFERENT agent than the request targeted — it does NOT, on its own, catch a
/// gateway CLAIMING an agent's identity via `ProxyRegister` (which re-registers any
/// already-approved agent_id with no per-agent secret) and then legitimately
/// answering for it. That claim-then-answer path is now closed by a SEPARATE
/// mechanism: `GatewayRouteStore::agent_routes` gains a STICKY `home_cluster_id`
/// column (distinct from the ephemeral `cluster_id`/`gateway_node` `register_fresh`
/// NULLs on every fresh registration), and `announce_connected`'s guarded UPDATE
/// atomically refuses a session-matched write whose presented `cluster_id` differs
/// from an already-bound `home_cluster_id` — `gateway_service_impl.cpp`'s
/// `NotifyStreamStatus` CONNECTED handler additionally runs a READ-ONLY pre-check
/// (`has_cluster_affinity_conflict`) before `registry_.set_gateway_route`, so a
/// rogue's own `register_fresh` win (unconditional, epoch-only, still unchanged —
/// this is NOT what closes) can no longer make its OWN subsequent CONNECTED move
/// `cluster_id` — and therefore this pool's `resolve()` target — to the rogue's
/// cluster. `cluster_id` itself is STILL gateway-asserted with nothing cryptographically
/// binding it to the presenting peer's identity (that is what mitigation 2, per-cluster
/// peer-identity binding at the gateway-upstream listener, would add — NOT
/// implemented; this listener still authenticates a peer as "some gateway", never
/// "gateway Y specifically") — the affinity mechanism instead closes the gap by
/// making a CHANGE of cluster for an agent already bound to one require either
/// genuine staleness (the real cluster unreachable for the full reap grace window)
/// or an explicit operator `clear_cluster_affinity` action, never a same-instant
/// claim. See `docs/adr/2002-high-availability-architecture.md` §7d's `#4669`
/// update for the full design and its one adjacent, pre-existing, unchanged
/// consideration (`reclaim_tombstoned_session`'s no-secret session adoption for an
/// already-tombstoned row — also covered by the SAME affinity guard, since that
/// call never touches `home_cluster_id` either). Do NOT describe multi-cluster mode
/// as providing FULL peer-authenticated trust-zone isolation (mitigation 2 is still
/// open) — but a rogue/compromised gateway can no longer silently redirect an
/// already-bound agent's traffic to itself merely by winning `ProxyRegister`'s
/// unauthenticated epoch race, which was the acceptance-criteria attack this issue
/// was filed to close.
