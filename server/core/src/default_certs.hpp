///
/// A fresh Yuzu install has no operator-provided certs. Rather than refuse to
/// start (the old behaviour, papered over everywhere with --no-tls --no-https),
/// the server generates a per-install internal CA + the server-side leaves on
/// first boot so every transport is encrypted with no operator action — while
/// making it impossible to miss that defaults are in use (see the six
/// notification surfaces wired in server.cpp / main.cpp).
///
/// Built on the PR1 engine: x509_ca (key/cert/CRL), key_provider (0600 key
/// custody), ca_store (inventory). No bundled/shared private keys — every
/// install generates its own root.

/// On first boot generates a per-install ECDSA P-384 root CA (10-year) and
/// P-256 leaves for the HTTPS, agent/management-gRPC, and gateway listeners.
/// Each leaf's SAN carries DNS:localhost, IP:127.0.0.1, IP:::1, DNS:<hostname>;
/// each leaf is sized to the CA's notAfter so it can never outlive the issuer.
/// A `default-marker.json` records {version, generated_at, ca_fingerprint,
/// expires_at, hostname}.
///
/// Idempotent: if the marker + every cert/key file exist and the CA cert's
/// fingerprint matches the marker, returns the existing set unchanged
/// (freshly_generated = false). If the marker is missing or anything is
/// corrupt/mismatched, regenerates the WHOLE set atomically (never a partial
/// state). When `ca_store` is non-null, records the root + each issued leaf in
/// the inventory (best-effort; a record failure is logged, not fatal).
///
/// Returns false only on an unrecoverable failure (e.g. keygen / signing /
/// filesystem error, or — when ca_store is non-null — a failed inventory write,
/// which is fatal so the inventory stays consistent for revocation/rotation) —
/// the caller should refuse to start rather than serve without the certs it
/// expected.
///
/// `extra_sans` (operator `--cert-san`) are injected into EVERY default leaf in
/// addition to the localhost/loopback/hostname base set. Each entry is
/// "dns:<name>", "ip:<addr>", or a bare value classified IP-vs-DNS by the exact
/// OpenSSL parser the SAN builder uses; a single entry may be comma-separated.
/// This lets an operator make the built-in certs valid for a deployment name
/// (e.g. "dns:gateway" so an agent reaching the gateway by that name passes
/// hostname verification) without standing up external PKI. Input is validated
/// and bounded — invalid IP literals, malformed/over-RFC-length DNS names,
/// control characters, and entries beyond a fixed cap are each dropped with a
/// warning, NEVER aborting the boot; an explicit "dns:"-prefixed IP literal is
/// honoured as a DNS-type SAN (warned) and wildcards are warned on. Extras apply
/// identically to all three leaves, exactly as the base SAN set already does.
///
/// NOTES: default-marker.json is crash-recovery idempotency, NOT tamper evidence
/// (an attacker who can write the 0700 cert dir is already past the boundary; the
/// fast path still chain-verifies the leaves as a corruption check). Beyond the
/// localhost / loopback IPs / detected hostname (+ any `extra_sans`), access by
/// another LAN IP or FQDN needs operator-provided certs or DNS. Leaves are sized
/// to the CA notAfter (10y) by design: there is no server-leaf auto-renewal, so a
/// short life would be a guaranteed future outage, and the operator is loudly
/// told to replace defaults. NOTE: adding/removing `extra_sans` does NOT
/// regenerate an existing set — the marker fast path returns the prior certs
/// unchanged; rotate (clear the dir or replace certs) for new SANs to take.
