/// @file approval_routes.hpp
/// Extracted from server.cpp's inline registrations onto the HttpRouteSink
/// seam (#2542 PR-9) — the 4-route Approval API: list/query pending
/// approval tickets, pending-count, and approve/reject one by id. One
/// owning store (`ApprovalManager`, ADR-0009/0065 — a Postgres-backed
/// one-time approval-ticket store; NOT the ADR-1005/0033 "core-owned
/// approval primitive", which is a separate, not-yet-built, design-only
/// mechanism for capability-declared `requires_approval` gates — see
/// `docs/adr/0033-access-control-spine.md` §4. `ApprovalManager` predates
/// that ADR and is one of the four pre-existing per-feature approval
/// surfaces its Context section (not "Alternatives considered") names, not
/// an instance of the future primitive).
/// Every handler body is copied verbatim from server.cpp; the changes are
/// the receiver (`web_server_->` -> `sink.`), the gate closure
/// (`require_permission` -> `deps.perm_fn`), the member access
/// (`approval_manager_.` -> `deps.approval_manager->`), the session
/// resolution (`auth_routes_->resolve_session` -> `deps.resolve_session_fn`),
/// the audit call (`audit_log(...)` -> `deps.audit_fn(...)`), and the event
/// emission (`emit_event(...)` -> `deps.emit_event_fn(...)`).
///
/// Routes (4) — gate in parens, all backed by `deps.approval_manager`
/// (`ApprovalManager`), none uses `auth_fn` (only `perm_fn`, which
/// internally resolves the session):
///   GET  /api/approvals                  (perm_fn Approval:Read)
///   GET  /api/approvals/pending/count    (perm_fn Approval:Read)
///   POST /api/approvals/:id/approve      (perm_fn Approval:Approve)
///   POST /api/approvals/:id/reject       (perm_fn Approval:Approve)
///
/// STORE-UNAVAILABLE ASYMMETRY (preserved verbatim, not a defect introduced
/// by this move): GET /api/approvals and both POST routes answer a 503
/// envelope (`{"error":{"code":503,...}}`) when `approval_manager` is
/// null; GET /api/approvals/pending/count instead answers 200 with
/// `{"count":0}` — a degraded pending-count reads as "nothing pending"
/// rather than an error, matching the original inline code exactly.
///
/// AUDIT ASYMMETRY (also preserved verbatim): GET /api/approvals and GET
/// .../pending/count are both pure reads and unaudited. The store-
/// unavailable 503 on all three gated-past routes is unaudited (it returns
/// before `deps.audit_fn` is ever reached). approve/reject audit BOTH
/// outcomes past that point — a denied review (e.g. the store's
/// self-approval segregation-of-duties block) is audited as `"denied"`
/// with `result.error()` as the detail, and a successful one as
/// `"success"` — and additionally emit an `approval.approved`/
/// `approval.rejected` event on success only (never on denial).
///
/// `log_safe` (used by approve/reject's denial-path log line) moved to
/// `log_safe.hpp` as part of this same PR — it had a second, still-inline
/// caller in server.cpp's instruction YAML update/create handlers, so it is
/// promoted to a shared free function rather than duplicated here
/// (mirroring `json_extract.hpp`'s #2557 precedent).
