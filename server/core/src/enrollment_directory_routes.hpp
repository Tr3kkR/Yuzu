/// #4031 (API-parity Batch A) REST v1 read twins for the five previously
/// untwinned GET routes `scripts/ci/api-parity/enrollment.json` carried at
/// `planned:#2146`:
///   - GET /api/v1/directory/users             (twin of legacy GET /api/directory/users)
///   - GET /api/v1/directory/status            (twin of legacy GET /api/directory/status)
///   - GET /api/v1/enrollment/auto-approve-rules (twin of GET /fragments/settings/auto-approve)
///   - GET /api/v1/enrollment/pending-agents     (twin of GET /fragments/settings/pending)
///   - GET /api/v1/settings/oidc                 (twin of GET /fragments/settings/directory —
///     see the naming-trap note below)
///
/// Every row's JSON shape comes from `enrollment_directory_model.hpp`'s
/// shared builder functions, per docs/api-twin-recipe.md §1 — but the
/// dashboard fragments (settings_routes.cpp) do NOT call them today; only
/// `directory_user_row_json`/`directory_status_json` are genuinely
/// multi-consumer (REST v1 + the two new MCP tools + the legacy
/// `/api/directory/*` route). See `enrollment_directory_model.hpp`'s file
/// header for the accurate 2-of-5 scope and why that matters.
///
/// #520 DECISION (prerequisite 2 of the #4031 issue, same policy question as
/// the sibling settings issue #4028): the three previously admin_fn_-gated
/// capabilities (auto-approve rules, pending agents, OIDC config) ship
/// REST-only here — no MCP twin. `require_admin`'s own comment
/// (auth_routes.cpp) names "settings... OIDC" as things MCP tokens must not
/// administer; #4028 recommends the identical REST-only + exception:#520
/// posture for its own admin_fn_-gated settings fragments, and this PR does
/// not diverge from that without a stated reason. The two directory-sync
/// routes (users/status) were ALREADY gated by RBAC (`Directory:Read`), not
/// `admin_fn_`, so #520 does not apply to them — they get full MCP twins.
///
/// NAMING TRAP: `GET /api/v1/settings/oidc` gates on the freshly-minted
/// `OidcConfig` securable, never `Directory` — see
/// enrollment_directory_model.hpp's file header and discovery_routes.cpp's
/// directory-sync section for the full explanation. Its REST v1 path lives
/// under `/api/v1/settings/...` (not `/api/v1/directory/...`) specifically to
/// avoid the collision.
///
/// CONFINEMENT (ADR-0017, #4031 hardening — adversarial review, post-merge):
/// `GET /api/v1/enrollment/pending-agents` is the one route among these five
/// whose rows carry genuine per-agent identity (`agent_id`, hostname, os,
/// arch, agent_version — `auth::PendingAgent`) — the other four return
/// human-identity rows, aggregate metadata, or rule/config objects, none of
/// which ADR-0017 applies to. It therefore gates on `FleetReadFn`
/// (`AuthRoutes::require_fleet_read`, the admit-then-filter chokepoint),
/// NEVER `PermFn`, per `.claude/routed-concerns.md` row 1's MUST/never — see
/// the route's own comment in enrollment_directory_routes.cpp for the
/// under-admission scenario this closes (a management-group-scoped
/// `Enrollment:Read` grant was previously 403'd outright instead of admitted
/// with a scoped, here always-empty, result, since pre-enrollment agents
/// hold no group membership).
