/// `DashboardRoutes::DispatchFn`, `WorkflowRoutes::CommandDispatchFn` — used
/// to carry only the caller's `exec_visible` VISIBILITY filter, never the
/// caller's IDENTITY. `dispatch_scope_ladder.hpp` can only recover a
/// principal from `ex->dispatched_by` for owner-scoped `from_result_set`
/// expressions; every other dispatch reached the seam anonymously even
/// though the handler had authenticated a real Session moments earlier
/// (CDX-P1-03/K-3 declined to widen the typedefs for this, judging the
/// benefit an audit-completeness LOW — see the comment this struct now
/// answers, at `server.cpp`'s `dispatch_confined`).
///
/// `DispatchCaller` is that missing identity, threaded alongside
/// `exec_visible` through the SAME injection point every surface already
/// uses (`ExecVisibleFn` → `CallerFn`). This header adds no behaviour: it is
/// pure plumbing so a later chokepoint wave can authorize on `principal`
/// instead of merely filtering on `exec_visible`.
