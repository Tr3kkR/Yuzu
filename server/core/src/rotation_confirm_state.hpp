/// @file rotation_confirm_state.hpp
/// Pure classifier for the state a `confirm_rotation` call finds when it reads
/// the active-credential set for an engine principal (design doc §7 overlap-pair
/// rotation). NO database access: it operates on the already-read `ApiToken`
/// vector while the caller still holds the per-principal advisory lock, so the
/// caller's in-transaction recheck stays authoritative. Factored out so a future
/// pre-consume recheck seam (#2443) can reuse the exact same taxonomy through an
/// inspection seam, without duplicating the state machine or the
/// terminal-vs-transient split.
///
/// POSITIVE-READ CONTRACT (the reason most one-active states are terminal, not
/// retryable): `read_active_for_principal_on_conn` returns an EMPTY vector on a
/// swallowed SELECT failure and NEVER a partial result — libpq's
/// `PGRES_TUPLES_OK` is all-or-nothing, and a `std::bad_alloc` while building
/// the vector unwinds rather than returning a short read. So any NON-empty
/// vector here is positive evidence of the real active-set size. Only
/// `kNoneActive` is ambiguous with a masked read failure; every other state is
/// a fact the caller can classify terminally (#2404).
///
/// LOAD-BEARING READ INVARIANT: this "positive read == ground truth" premise
/// holds ONLY because the caller reads the active set on the PRIMARY, inside the
/// same `pg_advisory_xact_lock`'d write transaction that will act on it — never
/// from a lagged read-replica or a stale snapshot. If a future change routes the
/// confirm read to a replica, a replica showing one active row while two exist
/// (or a not-yet-replicated revoke) would make the terminal classification wrong
/// on a genuinely live rotation. Keep the read primary + in-txn (UP-6, #2404).
