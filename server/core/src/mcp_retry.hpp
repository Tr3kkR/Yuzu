/// PR 3 remainder / ADR-1005 Decision 16 invariant A5).
///
/// Before this file, `retry_after_ms` was a bare literal (`5000`, `2000`, or
/// `-1`/`null`) repeated independently at ~60 call sites in `mcp_server.cpp` —
/// tuning meant finding and editing every occurrence, and none of it was
/// derived from anything. These constants replace those literals value-for-
/// value (behaviour-preserving) and each carries the mechanical derivation
/// rationale the exec plan asks for in place of a measured
/// dispatch-to-first-result latency histogram (`yuzu_command_duration_seconds`
/// measures full command completion, not first-result — that histogram does
/// not exist).
///
/// Several constants below share a numeric value with a neighbour. That is
/// coincidental historical pricing, not derivation — each comment says so
/// explicitly so a future re-tuning of one does not silently drag the other.
