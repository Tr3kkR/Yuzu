/// The registry-INDEPENDENT authz MODEL on the ADR-0033 §2 spine
/// (`docs/adr/0033-access-control-spine.md:141-159`): the

/// Module registers a tool or REST route.
///
/// WHAT THIS IS NOT: it does not create that registry, it does not read or
/// write `rbac.db`, and it enforces nothing on the wire — it is a header-only
/// vocabulary + a handful of pure classification rules, seeded with the SAME
/// securable/operation catalogue `RbacStore::seed_defaults()` hardcodes today
/// (`rbac_store.cpp:291-327`+ops, 22 seeded types, read-only reference) so PR1.9 has real data
/// to migrate rather than a speculative schema. `mcp_policy.hpp` is the other
/// read-only reference for the existing (securable, operation) vocabulary in
/// live use.
///
/// It also carries the shared #1788 fix primitive (`VisibleSet` /
/// `in_scope` / `filter_to_scope`): the one place that composes with — and
