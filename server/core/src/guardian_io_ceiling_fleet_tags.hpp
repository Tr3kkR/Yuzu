/// observability signal. Writer:
/// agents/core/src/guardian_io_ceiling_heartbeat.hpp
/// (`emit_guardian_io_ceiling_heartbeat_tags`). Bound by
/// tests/unit/server/test_guardian_arm_fleet_tags.cpp (shared with the arm-gauge
/// family's own test file - one small table, kept in its own header for the same
/// domain-separation reason the writer side splits guardian_arm_heartbeat.hpp
/// from guardian_io_ceiling_heartbeat.hpp: this signal is executor-fault-family,
/// not ack-ledger-family, and #3415/"PR-3a" is expected to extend THIS table with
/// more GuardianIoExecutor::Counters fields later, not the arm one).
///
/// ── SHAPE: SUM, MONOTONIC COUNTER (the ordinary shape, unlike the arm gauges) ──
/// `rejected_ceiling` genuinely IS a cumulative per-agent counter (never
/// decrements agent-side - see GuardianSparkRuntime::io_ceiling_rejections()'s
/// own doc comment), so the monitor-only fleet-SUM-of-counters shape used by the
/// journal family is the CORRECT one here, not something to avoid. MONITOR-ONLY
/// per docs/observability-conventions.md: neither `increase()` nor a bare `> 0`
/// is a sound alert over an unlabelled fleet sum of per-agent cumulative
/// counters. This tag NAMES the fault class (R5.1's own ask); it does not answer
/// "is some endpoint CURRENTLY under repeated pressure" - that windowed detector
/// is explicitly deferred to PR-6 once real measurement exists to size it
/// (~/.claude/plans/spark-rung9c-pr3-telemetry-KICKOFF-v2.md Decision 3).
