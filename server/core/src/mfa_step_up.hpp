///
/// Step-up gate for high-risk REST + Settings handlers (PR2 of the MFA
/// ladder; SOC 2 CC6.6 — privileged access requires fresh proof of
/// presence). PR1 established `Session::mfa_verified_at` as the
/// timestamp of the most recent successful MFA proof on a session;
/// this helper compares it against `cfg.mfa_step_up_window_secs` and
/// blocks the caller if the proof is stale.
///
/// Contract: returns true if the caller may proceed; false means the
/// helper has already written a 401 + A4 envelope to `res` and the
/// caller MUST return immediately without further response mutation
/// or audit emission.
///
/// Skips entirely (returns true) for:
///   - API token / MCP token principals — the bearer credential IS
///     the step-up moment (per `/auth-and-authz` skill, "MFA on every
///     API-token call" is explicitly out of scope; token issuance
///     happened with full MFA).
///   - Sessions belonging to users without MFA enrolled — consistent
///     with PR1's enforcement model (`optional` mode only kicks in
///     once a user opts into MFA).
///   - `window_secs == 0` — operator-disabled the gate (escape hatch
///     for diagnostic / break-glass scenarios; emits a startup WARN
///     in main.cpp).
///
/// Requires step-up (returns false) when:
///   - principal is a local session ("local" auth_source) AND user is
///     MFA-enrolled, OR principal is an OIDC session (PR3 — no local
///     enrollment lookup; gated purely on the `amr`-seeded timestamp);
///     AND
///   - `now - session.mfa_verified_at > window_secs`
///
/// OIDC interop (PR3): an OIDC session carries no local `users` row, so
/// the enrollment lookup is skipped for it. Its `mfa_verified_at` is
/// seeded in /auth/callback from the IdP `amr` claim (see
/// `amr_asserts_mfa` below). A session whose IdP login did not attest MFA
/// — or whose attestation is older than the window — fails the gate; the
/// remediation points the operator back through SSO (`/auth/oidc/start`)
/// rather than the local `/login/mfa/stepup` flow, which has no secret to
/// verify for an external identity.
///
/// Side effects on failure:
///   - `res.status = 401`
///   - `res.body` = A4 envelope: `{"error":{"code":401,"message":
///     "MFA step-up required","correlation_id":"req-...",
///     "remediation":"<source-specific>"},"meta":{"api_version":"v1",
///     "mfa_step_up_required":true,"challenge_url":"<source-specific>"}}`
///     where the challenge_url is `/login/mfa/stepup` for local sessions
///     and `/auth/oidc/start` for OIDC sessions.
///   - emits audit row: `mfa.step_up.required`, result=`error`,
///     target_type=`Endpoint`, target_id=`<action_label>`, detail=
///     username + age of last MFA proof in seconds.
