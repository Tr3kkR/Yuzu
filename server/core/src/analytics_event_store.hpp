/// @file analytics_event_store.hpp
/// PostgreSQL-backed outbox/spool for analytics events (ADR-0049, schema
/// `analytics_event_store`). `emit()` inserts into `analytics_buffer`; a
/// background thread drains undrained rows to registered `AnalyticsEventSink`s
/// in batches. Not operator state — expendable, best-effort telemetry.
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1 / ADR-0049): CONSTRUCTION is a DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE
/// from the playbook's fatal-on-migration-failure default — unlike every
/// other Postgres-backed store, a migration/open failure here leaves
/// `is_open()` false rather than failing server startup, because every
/// caller already null-guards/degrade-guards this store and analytics
/// defaults ON, so gating boot on this one non-critical table would
/// contradict its own fail-soft posture. See ADR-0049 §"Construction
/// posture" for the full argument. Unlike an EARLIER version of this store's
/// wiring, `server.cpp` does NOT `.reset()` the object on a failed open — it
/// stays constructed, wired to every consumer, with `is_open() == false`
/// (this matches the SQLite predecessor's own construction behavior, which
/// also never dropped the object on a failed open). This is load-bearing,
/// not cosmetic: every method here already internally fail-softs on
/// `is_open()` (`emit()` counts a `store_not_open` drop and returns; reads
/// return `nullopt`), so keeping the object alive is what lets a caller —
/// and the `/api/analytics/*` routes, and the four Prometheus metric
/// families — distinguish "disabled by `--no-analytics`" (object never
/// constructed) from "enabled but degraded" (constructed, `is_open() ==
/// false`) instead of collapsing both into the same nullptr. The store is
/// simply not constructed at all when `--no-analytics`
/// (`cfg_.analytics_enabled = false`) is passed. RUNTIME ingest is
/// fail-SOFT (`emit()` never blocks or throws into the calling request path —
/// writers include the auth/SCIM routes) and reads (`query_recent`,
/// `pending_count`) are degrade-distinguishable at the seam
/// (`std::optional`, `nullopt` on a DB error, never a false-empty). Backfill
/// is SKIPPABLE (ADR-0009 exception, recorded in ADR-0049): the spool is
/// transient by design and a drained row is already delivered.
///
/// The drain pass is single-sweeper fleet-wide via a
/// `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` lease (the AuditStore/ResultSetStore pattern),
/// but — unlike a pure-DB reap — the actual sink delivery is network I/O, so
/// the claim (advisory lock + `UPDATE ... RETURNING` inside one transaction)
/// and the send (no lease held) are two separate steps; a batch whose sinks
/// don't all succeed is reverted (`drained = false`) in a third, separate
/// statement. See analytics_event_store.cpp's `drain_batch()` for the exact
/// three-phase shape and its at-most-once-on-crash / at-least-once-on-partial-
/// sink-failure delivery semantics.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008): the store holds a `PgPool&` (not a
/// `sqlite3*`), runs its schema migration at construction on a pinned lease,
/// and schema-qualifies every runtime statement
/// (`analytics_event_store.analytics_buffer`) — pooled connections carry no
/// per-store search_path. Mutate-and-return uses `RETURNING`, never
/// `sqlite3_changes()`.
