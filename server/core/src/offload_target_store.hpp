/// @file offload_target_store.hpp
/// Postgres-backed offload-target config + delivery-log store (ADR-0059,
/// Wave 3 — SecretCodec-migrating store; mirrors WebhookStore's ADR-0057 (in
/// flight at the time of writing) conventions verbatim for the secrets seam,
/// since the two stores are near-twins — targets + deliveries tables,
/// wildcard `event_types`, an `enabled` flag). Schema `offload_target_store`,
/// two tables (`offload_targets` FK-cascaded by `offload_deliveries`).
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): construction and every `offload_targets`
/// create/list/get/get_by_name/delete mutator are AUTHORITATIVE/fail-hard —
/// this is operator-authored integration config (also referenced by name
/// from `spec.offload.targets` in InstructionDefinition YAML), so a silent
/// empty/false/nullopt-without-distinction on a DB error would read as "no
/// targets configured" or "nothing happened", neither of which is true.
/// `fire_event`'s internal enabled-target scan and `record_delivery`'s write
/// are DELIBERATELY fail-soft: they run off the gRPC hot path / a
/// worker-pool thread, a degraded read there just means "this tick's events
/// are not delivered", and there is no in-memory authoritative layer to fall
/// back on — dropping benignly (skip + warn + counter) is correct, never a
/// caller-visible error, exactly as it was before this migration.
///
/// `auth_credential` (ADR-0010 headline of this migration): a SecretCodec
/// envelope blob, never plaintext. `has_credential` is an INDEPENDENT
/// boolean column (ADR-0010 §Decision-1 anti-downgrade rule — "no credential
/// configured" must never be represented by column emptiness alone).
/// Decrypt happens at the dispatch site inside `deliver_single`, per
/// delivery — never batched/cached across a `batch_size > 1` flush (ADR-0010
/// §Consequences names batch-caching as an allowed option; this store
/// declines it, same as webhook). `OffloadTarget` (the public view) and the
/// buffering/dispatch path therefore never hold plaintext credential bytes
/// outside the one delivery attempt that needs them.
///
/// Backfill: NONE (ADR-0009's 2026-08-25 fresh-start-by-default amendment —
/// no production fleet has ever run a pre-Postgres build of any Yuzu store,
/// so there is no real legacy data to protect). Skipped unconditionally, no
/// flag, same as `ResponseStore`'s pre-existing precedent: the legacy
/// `offload_targets.db` is never read, and construction logs a one-time
/// "fresh start, no legacy backfill" line.
///
/// Reuses the WebhookStore delivery pattern (bounded-worker-pool dispatch
/// per delivery, async record - see store_worker_pool.hpp), and adds:
///   - typed auth (none / bearer / basic / hmac)
///   - server-side batching (`batch_size > 1` accumulates events into a
///     per-target buffer and flushes on threshold or on `flush_all()`)
///   - per-target name → callers can name a target and reference it from
///     `spec.offload.targets` in InstructionDefinition YAML
///
/// The `fire_event` call path is fire-and-forget and dispatches onto the
/// bounded worker pool so a slow endpoint can't drown the server.
