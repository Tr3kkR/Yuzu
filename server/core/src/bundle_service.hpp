// Live-query bundle — server-side core (ADR-0011: server-side async fan-out).
//
// One operator instruction carries a list of {plugin, action, params} steps. The
// server expands it into N ORDINARY plugin commands on one device (each its own
// command_id, all sharing one correlation id), then collates the responses on
// demand. The agent is unchanged — it only ever sees ordinary single commands.
//
// This header holds the PURE, testable pieces: step-list validation and the
// collate/aggregate logic (which matches response rows to the dispatched-step
// map by command_id). The dispatch fan-out + persistence + REST/MCP wiring live
// in the handler/orchestration layer.
