/// response query/aggregate/export surface (#2146 A2-R2) -- REST v1
/// (`rest_api_v1.cpp`'s `GET /api/v1/responses/{instruction_id}` family) and
/// MCP (`mcp_server.cpp`'s `query_responses` / `aggregate_responses` tools)
/// call these SAME functions so their JSON shapes cannot drift from each
/// other by construction (`docs/api-twin-recipe.md` Rule 1).
///
/// Distinct from `execution_model.hpp`'s `execution_response_row_json` --
/// that builder serves a DIFFERENT, already-shipped surface (the
/// execution-ID-keyed `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}/responses` twin, and
/// `query_responses`'s `execution_id` path before this PR). This file's
/// `response_query_row_json` is deliberately WIDER (adds `id`,
/// `instruction_id`, `error_detail`, `plugin`, `received_at_ms` on top of
/// `execution_response_row_json`'s agent_id/execution_id/status/output/
/// timestamp) and is now what `query_responses` calls on BOTH its
/// instruction_id and execution_id paths (#2146 A2-R2) -- see the file
/// comment on `execution_response_row_json` for why that builder was left
/// narrower rather than widened or removed.
///
/// The legacy unversioned routes (`response_routes.cpp`'s `GET
/// /api/responses/{instruction_id}`, `.../aggregate`, `.../export`) are NOT
/// retrofitted onto these builders -- they are frozen read-only reference
/// code for this PR (out of scope to touch), so a byte-for-byte "same
/// function" claim across all three surfaces does not hold for them. REST
/// v1 and MCP are the two callers this file exists to keep from drifting
/// from EACH OTHER; the legacy route remains a third, independent, frozen
/// copy of a narrower field set by explicit choice, not oversight.
///
/// No httplib.h, no MCP-specific include -- pure, I/O-free.
