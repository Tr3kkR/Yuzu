/// @file agent_decommission.hpp
/// The agent-decommission cascade (ADR-0024 Decision 11 / roadmap D-3): a single
/// entry point that fans `delete_agent(agent_id)` across EVERY per-agent store,
/// so that an operator decommission CAN durably erase a machine's stored rows.
/// This is the GDPR-erasure MECHANISM half; the per-store `delete_agent` methods
/// exist on each store but had ZERO production callers before this seam (they
/// were invoked only from unit tests). NOTE: the fan-out is built here, but its
/// PRODUCTION TRIGGER is DEFERRED — the gated/audited operator decommission route
/// that would call it lands with a later SLE PR (see `server.cpp`'s
/// `decommission_agent` "PRODUCTION TRIGGER — DEFERRED" note). Until that route
/// ships, the ADR's "offline agents purge ... via decommission" story is the
/// mechanism-ready-but-not-yet-operator-triggerable state, not yet operationally
/// realizable. §27 builds the fan-out and registers its stores with it.
///
/// ACCOUNTABLE, aggregated. Each per-store `delete_agent` now RETURNS a bool
/// status: true iff the delete actually committed, false on a transient failure
/// (a PG lease it cannot acquire in time, a rolled-back transaction, a SQL
/// error). This cascade attempts EVERY registered store even when an earlier one
/// throws or reports failure, aggregates the outcomes, and returns a structured
/// result the caller can audit (which stores were deleted / skipped / failed).
/// A store that returns false — a delete that did NOT happen — is recorded
/// `Failed`, never `Deleted`, so a `DecommissionResult` can never claim erasure
/// that a silently-rolled-back DELETE did not achieve (the ADR-0024 Decision 11
/// Art.17 evidence must be truthful).
///
/// LEASE DISCIPLINE (ADR-0012). Each `delete_agent` acquires and releases its
/// OWN lease/lock inside the call and returns before the cascade moves on, so
/// the cascade never holds one store's lease across another store's call — the
/// "never holding a lease across another store call" rule.
///
/// NULL-TOLERANT, like the sibling ingest seams. A store that is not configured
/// on this deployment (a null pointer) is recorded as `Skipped`, never a crash —
/// so the same cascade works on a Postgres-less deployment (only the SQLite
/// `InventoryStore` present) and on a full SLE deployment.
