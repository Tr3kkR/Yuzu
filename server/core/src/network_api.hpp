/// @file network_api.hpp
/// The FIRST per-family in-process API seam for the presentation/core/engine
/// split (ADR-0031, WS-A4/WS-A2r pilot). Abstract, ZERO store-shaped
/// dependencies — only the pure `network_perf_model.hpp` types + std headers,
/// so this header can be included by a future presentation-side client
/// without dragging the server's store/registry/pg:: layer along.
///
/// The method set == the public REST resources it stands in front of
/// (`GET /api/v1/network/fleet`, `GET /api/v1/network/devices`) so a
/// presentation/MCP caller consumes only what the public, versioned core API
/// serves (ADR-0031 B3, INV-31-4 "no private core API") — a local in-process
/// implementation today (`LocalNetworkApi`, network_api.cpp), a core HTTP
/// client after the WS-B2 cutover. Adding a method here without a
/// corresponding public REST/MCP resource would reintroduce a private core
/// API and defeat the point of the seam.
///
/// The store-backed factory (`make_local_network_api`) lives in the core-only
/// `network_api_local.hpp` — this header names no store type at all, not even
/// by forward declaration, so a presentation TU including it cannot reach one.
