/// @file access_review_store.hpp
/// Born-on-Postgres store (ADR-0006, schema `access_review_store`) for
/// Periodic Access Review CAMPAIGNS (SOC 2 CC6.2) — the persistence behind
/// "freeze the current grant population, have reviewers attest or flag each
/// grant, keep the evidence forever". This store does NOT compute the grant
/// population itself (that is `access_review_model.hpp`'s
/// `build_access_review`) — it only persists a campaign's FROZEN snapshot
/// and the per-grant decisions recorded against it.
///
/// Posture per ADR-0012 §1: **authoritative / fail-hard**, both at
/// construction AND at runtime — mirrors `EnginePrincipalStore`, not
/// `PreflightRunStore`'s durability-on-top posture. This is SOC 2 evidence:
/// a write that silently degraded to a no-op, or a read that silently
/// returned an empty result on a query error, would corrupt the audit trail
/// this feature exists to produce. Every mutator and every "must be
/// complete" reader returns a typed `std::expected<T, std::string>`.
/// Construction is fail-CLOSED — a reachable database whose schema can't
/// migrate leaves the store `!is_open()`, which server.cpp wires to
/// `startup_failed_` (server.cpp wiring is out of this file's scope — a
/// later task).
///
/// R3 (codex BLOCK) — freeze at open: `open_campaign` inserts the campaign
/// row AND one `decision='pending'` attestation row per entry in the
/// caller-supplied `frozen_population` — the COMPLETE current grant set,
/// captured by the caller via `access_review_model::build_access_review`
/// immediately before calling this — in ONE transaction. This is what makes
/// "every grant that existed when the campaign opened has a reviewable row"
/// a provable invariant rather than a hope: a grant created after
/// `open_campaign` returns is simply not part of this campaign (review it in
/// the next one), and a grant revoked after `open_campaign` returns is STILL
/// reviewable here (the row is frozen, not re-derived from live state) —
/// exactly the "who had access, on this date, and did a reviewer sign off on
/// it" question SOC 2 CC6.2 evidence must answer.
///
/// Deliberately NO prune method — unlike the `/auto` pre-flight/deployment
/// runs (which are operational scratch state, 14-day-pruned), a closed
/// access-review campaign IS the compliance evidence. It persists
/// indefinitely; any future retention policy is an explicit, separately-
/// reviewed decision, not a default cadence inherited from an unrelated
/// store.
///
/// Two tables (schema-qualified at runtime, unqualified in the migration —
/// the runner sets `search_path` for the migration transaction):
///   * access_review_campaign    — one row per opened review campaign.
///   * access_review_attestation — one row per (campaign, principal, role)
///     grant frozen at open; PK is the full 4-tuple so a decision can only
///     ever be recorded against a grant that was actually in the frozen
///     population (an unknown/foreign key never matches — see
///     `record_attestation`).
