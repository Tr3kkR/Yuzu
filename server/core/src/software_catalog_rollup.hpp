/// @file software_catalog_rollup.hpp
/// Background driver for the `/inventory` Software-tab catalogue rollup. Owns a single
/// thread that periodically calls `SoftwareInventoryStore::refresh_catalog_rollup()` —
/// the one expensive full-table `GROUP BY`, run OFF the request path so page reads hit
/// only the small precomputed rollup tables. The underlying `installed_software` changes
/// only on the daily sync, so a periodic recompute is strictly fresh-enough.
///
/// Lifecycle mirrors the app-perf roll-up thread: `start()` spawns the thread and runs
/// ONE refresh immediately (so the catalogue populates at boot), then refreshes on a
/// COMPLETION-SPACED cadence (sleep `interval` AFTER each recompute finishes, so a
/// recompute slower than the interval simply backs off — no overlap, no pile-up). The
/// thread borrows the store + pool, so `stop()` (signal + join) MUST run before the
/// store / pool are torn down (wired in server.cpp `stop()` beside the other join points).
/// A recompute failure is keep-last-good in the store; the thread logs + counts it and
/// keeps ticking (an exception escaping a std::thread entry would call std::terminate).
