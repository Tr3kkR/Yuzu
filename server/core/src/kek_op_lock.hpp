/// The cluster-wide KEK-operation advisory lock (#2395).
///
/// Extracted from server.cpp so it can be exercised directly by tests: this is
/// the highest-consequence resource in the KEK surface. A leaked session-scoped
/// advisory lock is not a transient error — it wedges every future KEK
/// operation across the whole cluster until the holding backend dies, and
/// because session advisory locks are RE-ENTRANT per backend, the wedge is
/// asymmetric: whichever request next draws the poisoned pooled connection
/// succeeds while every other connection gets 409 (gov unhappy-path UP-1).
/// Governance cpp-safety flagged that this had zero test coverage; it now has
/// a [pg] test that takes two real connections.
///
/// `KekOpLockGuard`'s release protocol is `pg::PgSessionAdvisoryLockGuard`
/// (`pg/pg_session_advisory_lock.hpp`) — the ONE reusable session-advisory-
/// lock release guard in this codebase; a second store needing a
/// session-scoped lock (e.g. the T12 rotation sweep's store-wide sweep lock,
/// `api_token_store.cpp`) reuses it rather than hand-rolling its own, exactly
/// the drift `dispatch_confined_arms`/`authz_topology_floor` exist to prevent
/// for their own chokepoints. See that header's own doc comment for the
/// aborted-transaction wedge this design closes.

/// TRAP (proven by `test_kek_op_lock_holder.cpp` against a real backend, not
/// by reasoning): `pg_locks.objid` is `oid` — internally an unsigned 32-bit
/// value — while `hashtext()` returns a SIGNED `int4` that is negative for
/// `hashtext('secrets_kek_op')` on every Postgres build observed so far
/// (`hashtext('secrets_kek_op') = -1189576286`). Empirically, Postgres's
/// `oid`-from-`integer` cast reinterprets the 32-bit pattern modulo 2^32
/// (`(-1189576286)::oid = 3105391010`, exactly matching what `pg_locks`
/// stores for this lock's `objid`), so comparing `objid = hashtext(...)`
/// directly DOES match in practice. We still spell out the explicit
/// bigint-mask-and-cast below rather than lean on that implicit
/// comparison-operator resolution: it makes the 32-bit-wraparound intent
/// obvious at the call site, and does not depend on Postgres continuing to
/// resolve a bare `oid = integer` comparison via that particular implicit
/// cast on every future version.

/// failed query and a genuinely unheld lock were indistinguishable to every
/// caller — including `GET /status`'s `lock_held` field, which derived
/// straight from `has_value()` and so reported `false` ("not held") on a
/// query failure. That is the one scenario this observability exists to

/// unreadable at read time) is a HELD lock; collapsing that into "no holder"
