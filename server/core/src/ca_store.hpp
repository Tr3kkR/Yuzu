/// @file ca_store.hpp
/// Migrated Postgres store (ADR-0006/0009/0053, schema `ca_store`) for Yuzu's internal CA
/// inventory + lifecycle (`ca_root`, `ca_issued`, `ca_crl_versions`).
///
/// Holds METADATA ONLY: the root certificate, the issued-cert inventory, and the CRL version
/// history. The root PRIVATE KEY is NEVER stored here — it lives behind a `KeyProvider` (a 0600
/// file in Milestone 1) and only its opaque `key_ref` is persisted in `ca_root`. This keeps the
/// crown-jewel key out of the database blast radius and lets a future HSM swap leave this store
/// untouched. `key_ref` is the ONLY thing this migration resolves the Wave 3 "secret-gated"
/// listing over — there is no envelope-encrypted column here, so `SecretCodec` is not involved
/// (ADR-0053).
///
/// Posture (ADR-0012 §1): AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard, both construction and runtime. The database
/// is the source of truth for the revoked-certificate set — a silently-empty/-false read on
/// `is_revoked`/`list_revoked` would silently accept a certificate that should have been
/// rejected, or publish a CRL that omits a real revocation. Every reader/mutator whose false/empty
/// result could feed that class of decision returns `std::expected<..., std::string>` (ADR-0036
/// type-distinguishability), prefixed `kCaDbErrorPrefix` on a genuine DB/lease failure — EXCEPT
/// `is_revoked()`, which stays a plain `bool` and is documented below to degrade to `true` (fail
/// CLOSED: treat "couldn't tell" as "revoked") rather than exposing a three-state channel on the
/// mTLS-accept hot path.
///
/// Substrate contract (ADR-0008): the store holds a `pg::PgPool&` (not a `sqlite3*`), runs its
/// schema migration at construction on a pinned lease, and schema-qualifies every runtime
/// statement (`ca_store.ca_root` / `ca_store.ca_issued` / `ca_store.ca_crl_versions`) — pooled
/// connections carry no per-store search_path. Mutate-and-return uses `RETURNING`, never
/// `sqlite3_changes()`.
///
/// **First-boot CA-root race (ADR-0053 "Root-singleton first-boot race").** Under per-instance
/// SQLite this race never existed — each server instance held its own local `ca.db`. A shared
/// Postgres substrate makes it possible for two instances to independently generate root material
/// and race to establish it. `try_insert_root()` is the dedicated, race-safe entry point for
/// FIRST-BOOT generation (`default_certs.cpp`): `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` means at most one
/// caller's row is ever inserted, and every caller — winner or loser — reads back the SAME row
/// that is now canonical. `set_root()` keeps its pre-migration unconditional-REPLACE contract for
/// the two callers that legitimately intend a replace: PR6 subordinate-CA import (an explicit,
/// single-writer, operator-triggered re-root) and test seeding. Never call `set_root()` from
/// first-boot generation — see `try_insert_root()`'s doc comment for why.
///
/// `migrate_from_sqlite()` retired (#3623, ADR-0053 Update): no production fleet ever ran a
/// pre-Postgres build of this store, so the mandatory three-table fingerprinted backfill it
/// implemented never had real legacy data to protect. `server.cpp` now runs
/// `legacy_sqlite_probe::warn_if_legacy_rows` over `ca_root`/`ca_issued`/`ca_crl_versions`
/// instead — silent unless real rows are found, never blocks boot.
