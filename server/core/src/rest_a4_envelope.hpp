/// Lives in `yuzu::server::detail` rather than `rest_api_v1.cpp`'s

/// `set_chunked_content_provider`, which httplib stores opaquely and
/// is not externally invokable from a TestRouteSink dispatch.

/// Both helpers are pure: no I/O, no global state beyond the
/// process-monotonic counter in `make_correlation_id`.

/// Every field is nullable/optional; the builder emits:
///   - `retry_after_ms`: `null` unless `retry_after_ms` is set (A4 lists it
///     required+nullable, so it is ALWAYS a key in the body);
///   - `remediation`: omitted when empty (the REST convention — absence
///     carries the same "no recovery hint" meaning per §A4);
///   - `permission`: emitted as `"<securable_type>:<operation>"` when set —
///     the §A4 kPermissionDenied specialisation that names the missing grant;
///   - `approval_id` + `status_url`: emitted when set — the §A4
///     kApprovalRequired specialisation so a worker can poll the workflow
///     rather than re-issue the request.

/// The `string_view` members are non-owning: callers pass string literals or
/// temporaries whose lifetime spans the synchronous `error_json_a4` /
/// `a4_denial` call (the builder copies bytes into the output before
/// returning), which holds at every denial site.
