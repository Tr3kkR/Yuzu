/// @file dex_perf_api.hpp
/// The SIXTH per-family in-process API seam for the presentation/core/engine
/// split (ADR-0031, WS-A4) — `DexPerfApi`, covering the DEX **app-perf-over-time**
/// surface: the `/api/v1/dex/perf/*` resources (minus `/compare`, already
/// `VerifyApi`) plus `GET /api/v1/dex/devices/{id}/app-perf`. The sequel to the
/// DEX **signals/experience** seam (`DexApi`, PR #4582) — this is DEX's SECOND
/// abstract seam, not a widening of the first (the two cut by RESOURCE
/// sub-namespace + DATA CLASS: identity/experience signal reads vs
/// heartbeat-now + retained percentile-series performance reads).
///
/// Abstract, store-type-free BY CONSTRUCTION: it includes only the pure
/// `dex_perf_model.hpp` (heartbeat-now, F2a) + `dex_app_perf_pure.hpp`
/// (percentile-series output shapes, F2b — NOT the store-coupled umbrella
/// `dex_app_perf_model.hpp`, which also pulls the core-only builders) +
/// `app_perf_types.hpp` (the two floor-free/no-suppression row types that
/// legitimately cross the seam verbatim) + std. Its transitive include closure
/// NAMES NO STORE TYPE (`AppPerfDailyRow`, `AppPerfFleetRow`, `PgPool`, …) —
/// matching its five sibling abstract headers and enforced by
/// check-seam-closure.py's abstract-header store-type probe.
///
/// A PR #4582 external review found the DEX signals seam's OWN abstract header
/// failed this exact property (a shared model header bundled pure structs WITH
/// store-pointer-taking builder declarations) — this seam applies that lesson
/// from its first commit: `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` is split into a pure half
/// (`dex_app_perf_pure.hpp`, what this header includes) and a core-only half
/// (`dex_app_perf_builders.hpp`, forward-declares the stores + holds the
/// `AppPerfFleetRow`/`AppPerfDailyRow`-taking builders — included only by the
/// impl `dex_perf_api.cpp` and the store-reaching consumers).
///
/// ── Which row types cross the seam, and why (the seam's own leak-boundary) ──
/// `AppPerfVersionDeviceRow` (the version-devices drill) and `AppPerfAppSummary`
/// (the app picker) are RELOCATED pure PODs (`app_perf_types.hpp`) that DO cross
/// this seam verbatim — both resources are floor-FREE / no-suppression-needed
/// (the drill already names `agent_id`; the picker carries no per-agent identity
/// at all), so there is no floor/audit gate for a raw row to bypass.
/// `AppPerfFleetRow` (the raw B2 aggregate, carrying histogram arrays) and
/// `AppPerfDailyRow` (the raw B1 per-device row) do NOT cross — the fleet/group/
/// tag trend resources apply `kDexCohortFloor` suppression to `AppPerfFleetRow`
/// BEFORE anything crosses (the impl returns the already-floor-adjusted, pure
/// `AppPerfTrendPoint`), and the per-device drill returns its JSON already
/// serialized (`device_app_perf_json`) rather than naming `AppPerfDailyRow` in
/// this header at all — the ONE store-reaching serializer that touches it stays
/// core-only (`dex_app_perf_builders.hpp`).
///
/// Each method == ONE public DEX app-perf resource so a presentation/MCP caller
/// consumes only what the public, versioned core API serves (ADR-0031 B3,
/// INV-31-4 "no private core API") — a local in-process implementation today
/// (`LocalDexPerfApi`, dex_perf_api.cpp), a core HTTP client after the WS-B2
/// cutover.
///
/// Deliberately NOT in this seam:
///   - `GET /api/v1/dex/perf/compare` is the `VerifyApi` seam (the `/auto`
///     VERIFY before/after comparison) — a DIFFERENT data class (cohort-PAIRED,
///     evidential, deliberately floor-free) with its own pure model
///     (`app_perf_compare.hpp`), not this seam's `AppPerfProviders::cohort`
///     (dead in production; see `dex_app_perf_builders.hpp`'s banner).
///   - `GET /api/v1/dex/devices/{id}/live` is a bounded live-registry poll, not
///     a stored read at all (`DexApi`'s own scope note; still unowned).
///
/// ── Why ONE seam for heartbeat-now (F2a) AND app-perf-over-time (F2b) ──
/// A single consumer class already held both halves, before this seam existed
/// (`dex_routes.hpp`'s now-removed `PerfFn` + `app_perf_providers_` members);
/// ONE securable
/// (`GuaranteedState:Read`) and ONE floor constant (`kDexCohortFloor`,
/// `dex_perf_model.hpp`) is consumed by BOTH — splitting them would put the
/// floor's owner and a consumer in different seams; and the heartbeat-now half
/// is thin (effectively one `snapshot(cohort_key)`-shaped read), too small for
/// its own family. The cut is by DATA CLASS (both are performance
/// measurements, distinct from `DexApi`'s identity/experience signals), not by
/// URL shape or by which store backs them (a `/dex/perf/*` URL prefix is NOT
/// itself an architecture argument — see the caveat this exact framing drew in
/// review).
///
/// LINK RESIDUAL (WS-B2, tracked like #4579 — not yet filed separately): the
/// heartbeat-now pure transforms (`dex_perf_fleet_now` etc., `dex_perf_model.cpp`)
/// and the app-perf-over-time pure transforms (`app_perf_fleet_trend` etc.,
/// `dex_app_perf_model.cpp`) are already core-side TUs — this seam does not
/// reintroduce the DEX-signals-seam's presentation-TU link residual.
///
/// ── Consumer rewire status (disclosed, not silent) ──
/// The REST (`rest_api_v1.cpp`) and MCP (`mcp_server.cpp`) consumers are
/// REWIRED through this seam — all 9 `/api/v1/dex/perf/*` handlers + the
/// `/api/v1/dex/devices/{id}/app-perf` drill, and their 9 MCP tool twins +
/// `get_dex_device_app_perf`, call `dex_perf_api->method(...)` /
/// `dex_perf_api_->method(...)` exclusively (zero remaining direct
/// `app_perf_providers.<member>()`/`dex_perf_fn()` calls in either file —
/// grep-verified). This mirrors DexApi's own first-commit shape (PR #4582,
/// 241e835f5): the REST+MCP rewire lands together with the seam build.
///
/// #4626 completed the dashboard rewire (`dex_routes.cpp`'s F2a/F2b
/// fragments, `dex_perf_ui.cpp`, `dex_app_perf_ui.{hpp,cpp}`) — mirroring how
/// #4576 completed `DexApi`'s own dashboard deferral. `AppPerfProviders` (the
/// pre-seam provider bundle) is RETIRED — this seam's `dex_perf_api` instance
/// is now the SOLE consumer for every surface (REST, MCP, dashboard).
/// GAP-1: the model-picker's device-tag distinct-values read has NO home in
/// `DexPerfApi` (no public fleet-wide "distinct tag values" resource exists
/// yet) — `DexRoutes` carries it as its own standalone, disclosed
/// `TagValuesFn` outside this seam (see that type's own doc comment).
/// See `dex_app_perf_builders.hpp`'s banner for why VerifyApi's `.cohort`
/// input shape specifically is not folded into this seam (a Fable review of
/// the plan found it dead in production and would drag VerifyApi's types
/// into this closure). `check-seam-closure.py`'s `dex_perf` family now
/// enforces the dashboard consumer TUs too (`dex_perf_ui.cpp`,
/// `dex_app_perf_ui.{hpp,cpp}`), narrowing the gap to `network`'s
/// five-consumer-enforced posture — `dex_routes.cpp`/`.hpp` itself stays
/// OUTSIDE the enforced set (it also registers the still-store-coupled
/// DEX-SIGNALS fragments, out of this seam's scope; see the script's own
/// comment on that family entry).
