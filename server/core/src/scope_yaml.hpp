// Scope-walking YAML DSL surface (PR-E, design docs/scope-walking-design.md §7).
//
// A `spec.scope:` block may carry a `fromResultSet:` reference (a result-set id
// or per-operator alias) and/or a `selector:` (platform + tags), composed with
// AND. This module parses that block, validates the design's rules, and lowers
// it to a scope-engine expression string the existing parser/resolver already
// consume (scope_engine.cpp `from_result_set:` / `ostype` / `EXISTS tag:`).
//
// Resolution is lazy: lowering produces a string only; result-set membership is
// resolved at dispatch by AgentRegistry::evaluate_scope. A definition carrying a
// `fromResultSet:` that has since expired is still valid YAML.

/// Parsed `spec.scope` block. All fields default to "absent".

// The scope resolver (agent_registry.cpp) owner-checks result-set ids but does
// NOT resolve per-operator aliases — callers must pre-resolve at the dispatch
// layer where the owner is known. These free functions do that, sharing the
// from_result_set:<ref> token grammar of scope_engine.cpp's tokenizer (idents:
// alnum / _ . : - *) and skipping quoted string literals.

/// Rewrite each `from_result_set:<alias>` atom (a ref not already a canonical
/// `rs_` id) to its canonical id via store->resolve_alias(owner, alias).
/// Canonical ids and unresolved (genuinely-not-found) aliases are left as-is
/// (they no-match downstream — stale drops silently, design §4.3). No-op
/// (returns `expr` unchanged) when `owner` is empty or `store` is null,
/// mirroring the resolver's empty-principal contract.
///
/// Returns `std::unexpected(DbError)` — ADR-0036 fail-closed contract — when
/// `resolve_alias` hits a Postgres error mid-rewrite. The caller MUST treat
/// this as "abort dispatch" (503/internal-error), never fall back to the
/// unresolved expression: an unresolved `from_result_set:<alias>` atom
/// no-matches downstream and, under a `NOT` combinator, INVERTS to
/// match-every-agent — the same class of fleet-wide fail-open
/// `member_set_owned`'s contract guards against.
