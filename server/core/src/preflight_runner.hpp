/// @file preflight_runner.hpp
/// Background lifecycle driver for `/auto` pre-flight runs — the
/// re-dispatch-on-reconnect loop. Mirrors PolicyEvaluator: this owns only the
/// per-cycle `tick()`; the server owns the thread that calls it on a cadence and
/// joins it BEFORE the stores in `stop()` / `~ServerImpl`.
///
/// Per tick, for each `running` run still inside its window: re-dispatch every
/// applicable check (under the run's per-check execution_id) to the frozen
/// targets that aren't fully answered yet — `AgentRegistry::send_to` drops
/// offline agents silently, so this costs a map lookup for them and catches the
/// reconnected ones. The checks are READ-ONLY / idempotent, so re-dispatch is
/// safe (load-bearing). Then recompute the grid from query_by_execution and
/// persist it; at the deadline (or once nothing is pending) flip the run
/// complete. Old runs are pruned past the retention window.
///
/// Lease discipline (ADR-0012): list/read/persist each take + release a
/// PreflightRunStore lease; the ResponseStore read and the gRPC dispatch run
/// with NO run-store lease held.
