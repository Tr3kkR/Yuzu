/// @file file_retrieval_routes.hpp
/// REST surface for the PR1.6a one-time upload grant + authenticated
/// chunked receive protocol (CC-06 server-side fix). See
/// `upload_grant_parsers.hpp`'s file header for the frozen wire protocol
/// this implements verbatim, and `docs/adr/3004-artifact-blob-storage.md`
/// for the design rationale.
///
/// Two trust domains on one surface:
///   * Operator routes (mint/list/revoke) — `AuthFn`/`PermFn`-gated exactly
///     like every other REST securable (`UploadGrant:Write/Read/Delete`).
///   * Agent routes (session open/chunk/status/commit/cancel) — there is NO
///     authenticated agent REST transport (see the parsers header's WHY THE
///     DESIGN CHANGED note), so these gate on the grant/session BEARER
///     CREDENTIAL alone, never `AuthFn`/`PermFn`. `Deps` therefore carries
///     NO agent-identity resolver — agent identity is a server-side fact
///     recorded on the grant row at mint time and never asserted by the
///     client on any of these five routes.
///
/// `Deps` intentionally has no `RbacStore*`/`ManagementGroupStore*` member:
/// `list_read_fn` decouples this header from those stores exactly the way
/// `DexRoutes::VisibleSetFn` does (dex_routes.hpp) — the caller wires it to
/// `RbacStore::authorize_list_read` in server.cpp; this header only needs
/// the resulting 3-way decision shape.
