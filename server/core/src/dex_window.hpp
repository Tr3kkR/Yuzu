/// PURE window-selector + OS-filter resolvers for the DEX family — the single
/// source of truth for how the dashboard fragments, the `/api/v1/dex/*` REST
/// surface, the MCP DEX tools, and the in-process `DexApi` seam all interpret
/// the `window`/`os` request tokens (ADR-0031 WS-A4).
///
/// This header is store-free and httplib-free BY CONSTRUCTION (only `<string>`).
/// It exists so the CORE `DexApi` implementation (`dex_api.cpp`) can resolve a
/// window/os token WITHOUT including `dex_routes.hpp` or `dex_view_types.hpp`
/// (both of which pull `<httplib.h>`) — a presentation/transport dependency has
/// no place in a core API impl. `dex_routes.hpp` and `dex_view_types.hpp` now
/// `#include` THIS header and keep re-declaring these symbols transitively, so
/// every existing caller is unaffected (ODR-safe relocation, same pattern as
/// `dex_types.hpp`). The definitions live in the dashboard TU unchanged.
