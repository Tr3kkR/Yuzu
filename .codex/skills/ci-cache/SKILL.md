# ci-cache

Canonical caching patterns for Yuzu CI workflows. **CI eats more time than dev — get this right the first time.**

## TL;DR — two patterns

| Runner kind | Cache mechanism | Snippet |
|---|---|---|
| GHA-hosted (`ubuntu-24.04`, `macos-15`, `windows-latest`) | `actions/cache/restore` + paired `actions/cache/save` | [GHA-hosted](#gha-hosted-ephemeral-runners) |
| Self-hosted (`yuzu-wsl2-linux`, `yuzu-local-windows`, future macOS) | Local filesystem under `runner.tool_cache` | [Self-hosted](#self-hosted-runners) |

**Hard rule (enforced by `.github/workflows/zizmor.yml`):** never use `save-always: true` on `actions/cache@`. The input is deprecated by the actions/cache maintainers as "does not work as intended and will be removed in a future release." The `Guard — no save-always on actions/cache` step in zizmor.yml fails any workflow audit if `^[[:space:]]*save-always:` reappears as a YAML key. Don't try to silence the guard — rewrite the cache step using the snippets below.

## GHA-hosted (ephemeral runners)

Each job starts on a fresh disk. The cache lives in GitHub's blob storage and is moved over the network on restore + save. Use the **split restore + always-save pattern**:

```yaml
- name: Restore <thing>
  id: cache-<thing>
  uses: actions/cache/restore@55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9 # v6.1.0
  with:
    path: <path>
    key: <primary-key-with-strong-uniqueness>
    restore-keys: |
      <progressively-shorter-fallback-prefixes>

# ... build / test / install steps that produce the cache content ...

- name: Save <thing>
  # `if: always()` is the documented replacement for the deprecated
  # `save-always: true` input — runs even on Build/Test failure, which
  # is the only behaviour `save-always` was meant to deliver. NOTE: this
  # is right for an ADDITIVE cache only — see "Additive vs
  # coherent-artifact caches" below before copying it onto a tree. The
  # `cache-hit != 'true'` gate skips the upload when the primary key
  # already matched on restore (no new content to save, no point
  # paying the upload cost).
  if: always() && steps.cache-<thing>.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  uses: actions/cache/save@55cc8345863c7cc4c66a329aec7e433d2d1c52a9 # v6.1.0
  with:
    path: <path>
    key: ${{ steps.cache-<thing>.outputs.cache-primary-key }}
```

**Additive vs coherent-artifact caches — `always()` is not always right:**

The `if: always()` above is correct for an **additive** cache, where every object saved is
independently valid and a partial save is merely a smaller cache. `ccache` is the type case.

It is **wrong** for a **coherent-artifact** cache — `vcpkg_installed`, or any installed-prefix
tree — where the entry only means anything as a complete set. A run cancelled or failed
part-way saves a half-populated tree, and because the key inputs (manifest + baseline) still
claim it is complete, the next run restores it as an exact hit, rebuilds everything anyway, and
then **skips its own save** because `cache-hit == 'true'` — so the good tree is discarded and
the poison persists. GHA cache keys are immutable, so nothing can overwrite it; only
out-of-band deletion recovers. This is not hypothetical: it cost the canary ~65 min per run
until #3229.

Note the split is about CONTENT VALIDITY, not about key occupancy. The
`cache-hit != 'true'` skip means ANY entry — additive or not — locks its key for
as long as it lives, so a thin entry saved by a cancelled run suppresses later
saves in both cases. For an additive cache that costs a colder cache; for a
coherent artifact it hands out a tree that reads as complete. Only the second is
a correctness problem, which is why only the second is gated here — but do not
read "additive" as "immune".

Two consequences follow, and they are different questions:

**Correctness** — only coherent artifacts need it. Gate the save on the **producing
step's** outcome, not the job's.

**Key occupancy** — both classes need thought. A thin entry written under an exact
key is hit by every later run with the same inputs, which then skips its own save,
and the key is immutable. For an additive cache that costs a permanently colder
cache rather than a wrong answer, so the gate is looser: save when the producing
step RAN (pass *or* fail — a failed build's objects are still worth keeping), skip
only when it was cancelled or never started. `ci.yml`'s canary ccache save is the
worked example.

**Key inputs must be stable.** `hashFiles` globs the whole workspace and does not
honour `.gitignore`, so a bare `**/*.cpp`-style glob also hashes anything an
earlier restore step materialised — dependency trees included. The key then differs
between a cold and a warm run and the namespace splits. Scope the glob to the
source roots you actually compile (#3270).

For coherent artifacts, additionally gate on the **producing step's** outcome, not the job's:

```yaml
- name: Install deps
  id: install-deps
  run: ...

- name: Save <tree>
  # always() is still required — see the invariant above; without it the
  # implicit success() would also skip the save when only a LATER step
  # (e.g. Build) failed, even though the tree is complete and worth keeping.
  if: always() && steps.install-deps.outcome == 'success' && steps.cache-<thing>.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
```

**Key construction (D3 of the CI overhaul plan):**

For vcpkg: include manifest + every overlay triplet + the pinned baseline. Example:

```yaml
key: vcpkg-<triplet>-${{ env.VCPKG_COMMIT }}-${{ hashFiles('vcpkg.json', 'vcpkg-configuration.json', 'triplets/*.cmake') }}
restore-keys: |
  vcpkg-<triplet>-${{ env.VCPKG_COMMIT }}-
  vcpkg-<triplet>-
```

For ccache: hash all `.cpp` / `.hpp` / `.h` source. Cascading restore-keys keep the cache mostly warm across source changes:

```yaml
key: ccache-<leg>-${{ hashFiles('**/*.cpp', '**/*.hpp', '**/*.h') }}
restore-keys: |
  ccache-<leg>-
```

**Branch-scope gotcha (the canary cold-start lesson from PR #740):**

GHA cache scope is **branch-isolated** with PR runs scoped to `refs/pull/<N>/merge`. A PR job can read caches from (a) its own ref, (b) the repo's default branch, (c) the PR's base branch. **Sibling-PR caches are unreadable.** If a job only ever runs on `pull_request`, its cache never lands on `refs/heads/main` and every PR cold-starts.

Fix: also trigger the job on `push` to the branch PRs actually base on. The canary job in `ci.yml` does this via `detect-ci-changes` firing on `pull_request` plus `push` to `refs/heads/main` **and `refs/heads/dev`**. Warming only the default branch is not enough here and silently stopped working: this repo integrates on `dev`, `main` moves only at release time, and with no `main` push for five weeks the warm scope was simply empty — every PR then saved its own private ~843 MB copy of a byte-identical tree, six of them live at once against a 10 GB repo cap (#3233). Pick the branch by scope rule (c), not by convention, and check it is actually pushed to.

## Self-hosted runners

Self-hosted runners (`yuzu-wsl2-linux`, `yuzu-local-windows`, and any future self-hosted macOS) keep state across jobs. **Skip GHA's blob-storage cache entirely** — round-tripping ~1 GB of vcpkg binaries through GHA storage when the same data already lives on the runner's local disk is an unforced loss. Pin caches to `runner.tool_cache` (a stable per-runner path that survives between jobs but is owned by the runner setup, not the workspace):

```yaml
# Self-hosted: no actions/cache step at all. Set the env var that
# the build tool consumes and let it manage its own on-disk cache.
- name: Configure local cache paths (self-hosted)
  if: ${{ !contains(runner.name, 'GitHub') && runner.environment == 'self-hosted' }}
  run: |
    echo "VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE=${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-vcpkg-binary-cache-${{ matrix.os }}" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
    echo "CCACHE_DIR=${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-ccache-${{ matrix.os }}" >> "$GITHUB_ENV"
    mkdir -p "${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-vcpkg-binary-cache-${{ matrix.os }}"
    mkdir -p "${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-ccache-${{ matrix.os }}"
```

(See `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for the existing `VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE → runner.tool_cache` wiring on the Windows self-hosted runner — that's the pattern.)

**Why `runner.tool_cache` and not `~/.cache/...`:**

- `runner.tool_cache` is a stable, runner-managed path. It survives `actions/checkout` workspace cleanup (which can wipe `vcpkg_installed/` if `clean: true` is set, see lesson from session 2026-04-28).
- It's per-runner (not per-job), so back-to-back jobs on the same runner share warm caches.
- It's outside `${{ github.workspace }}`, so concurrent jobs can't race on the same file.

**Per-triplet (not per-matrix-leg) scoping:**

If two matrix legs build the same triplet (e.g., `gcc-13 debug` and `gcc-13 release` both build `x64-linux`), share the cache directory keyed on the **triplet**, not the matrix axis. The CI overhaul commit on 2026-04-28b establishes this — cumulative first-warm cost dropped ~5 h → ~2 h 20 min by collapsing per-matrix scopes into per-triplet scopes.

**Sentinel-driven invalidation:**

Self-hosted caches stay until something invalidates them. `scripts/ci/vcpkg-triplet-sentinel.sh` is the canonical invalidator: it computes the cache key from `vcpkg.json` + `vcpkg-configuration.json` + overlay triplets + `VCPKG_COMMIT`, compares against the stored sentinel, and wipes the triplet tree (and the orphaned-registry `vcpkg/info/` directory — see #741) on drift. Always run the sentinel before `vcpkg install` on self-hosted.

**Future self-hosted macOS:**

When the self-hosted Mac lands (replacing or augmenting the `macos-15` GHA runner), it should follow the self-hosted pattern: drop the `actions/cache` step from the macOS leg, set `CCACHE_DIR=${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-ccache-macos-${{ matrix.build_type }}` and `VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE=${{ runner.tool_cache }}/yuzu-vcpkg-binary-cache-arm64-osx`, and rely on the runner's local SSD. ccache deltas on macOS are the same shape as Linux (~30 G with `CCACHE_MAXSIZE=30G`); the GHA-hosted cap of 10 GB total per repo no longer applies.

## Reading the existing tree

When in doubt, read these as worked examples (all up-to-date as of v0.12.0-rc0):

| File | Pattern shown |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` macOS legs (lines 564–675) | GHA-hosted split restore + paired save |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` canary (job `canary:`; line numbers drift, grep the job name) | GHA-hosted split restore + paired save + push-to-main/dev warming |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` (lines 703–751) | Restore-only (release builds consume cache, never produce — see comment block) |
| `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | Self-hosted `VCPKG_DEFAULT_BINARY_CACHE → runner.tool_cache` |
| `scripts/ci/vcpkg-triplet-sentinel.sh` | Sentinel invalidation logic, including the orphaned-registry self-heal |

## When to add a new cache

Three questions to answer before you add `actions/cache/restore`:

1. **What's the cache key?** Must be uniquely determined by the inputs that change the cache content. Source-file hash for ccache; manifest + triplet + baseline for vcpkg; pip-tools requirements file hash for `~/.cache/pip`. If the key collapses two materially-different states into one entry, the cache is poisoned.
2. **Where does it save?** GHA-hosted → blob storage with branch-scope rules. Self-hosted → local `runner.tool_cache`. Pick one based on the runner kind, never both.
3. **Will it ever warm via a push to main or dev?** If only `pull_request` writes the cache, every PR cold-starts. Either accept that or add a push trigger on the branch PRs base on that produces the cache (see canary in ci.yml).

If any of those three feels wrong, the cache step is wrong. Re-read this skill before pushing.
