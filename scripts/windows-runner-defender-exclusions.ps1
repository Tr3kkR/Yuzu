.SYNOPSIS
    Apply the Windows Defender exclusion set required by the yuzu-local-windows
    self-hosted GitHub Actions runner.

.DESCRIPTION
    Without these exclusions, Defender realtime-scans every file vcpkg
    installs, every .obj MSVC writes, every file tar.exe extracts from
    the vcpkg cache archive, and every SQLite temp DB the test suite
    creates under C:\WINDOWS\SystemTemp. That scanning activity:

      * stalls the release workflow's Build Windows x64 job until the
        60-min timeout kills it (diagnosed 2026-04-18 during v0.11.0-rc1
        — MsMpEng was running at 40.9% CPU during a stuck vcpkg cache
        extraction);
      * has been implicated in flaky Guardian engine unit tests where
        SQLite write-then-list returns inconsistent results on the
        Windows runner (observed on PR #473 Windows MSVC debug job
        72502796929, passed on re-run without code changes once runner
        load eased, with SystemTemp\yuzu_test_guardian_* not in the
        exclusion list).

    Re-running this script is idempotent — Defender deduplicates
    exclusion entries.

.NOTES
    Run elevated under PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`).
    Stock Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not supported — the repo saves .ps1
    files as UTF-8 without BOM (POSIX/git convention), which PS 5.1
    misreads as the system ANSI codepage and mangles any non-ASCII
    characters. See docs/windows-build.md for the project-wide PS 7+
    standard and issue #517 for the migration history.

    Defender persists the preference across reboots. Reversible with
    Remove-MpPreference.
