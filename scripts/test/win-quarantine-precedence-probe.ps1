win-quarantine-precedence-probe.ps1 - #3284 ground truth: once
win_quarantine's BlockAllInbound/BlockAllOutbound rules are live, does an
AllowIn_<ip>/AllowOut_<ip> whitelist rule still let that address through?
Runs entirely ON the target host over an elevated SSH session.

============================================================================
 DO NOT RUN AGAINST A HOST YOU CANNOT PHYSICALLY REACH IF IT GOES WRONG.
============================================================================
-Execute applies win_quarantine's real rule set. If Allow does NOT win
precedence on this build, the host's network drops to loopback only -
including the SSH session driving this script. Two independent scheduled-
task watchdogs exist to undo that.

THE ONE HARD RULE: a Block rule is never applied until BOTH watchdogs have
been registered AND OBSERVED to actually remove a real rule when triggered.
`Get-ScheduledTask` reporting `Ready` proves only that Task Scheduler
accepted the registration, not that the action works. So before anything
that blocks traffic runs: register both -> create one harmless
YuzuQuarantine_Probe ALLOW rule -> Start-ScheduledTask the primary NOW ->
wait for it to report done -> assert the probe rule is GONE (the only proof
that counts) -> repeat for the backstop -> only then re-arm both and
proceed. Either proving run failing to remove the rule aborts the whole run
right there - see Test-WatchdogProving / Invoke-Abort below.

-DryRun (default, never destructive): capture profile policy -> preflight ->
register -> prove both -> unregister -> exit. Never writes a Block rule,
leaves zero residue, safe to re-run.

On profile defaults, precisely: the proving runs FIRE the watchdog's real
recovery body, which does write the profile policy - it restores the values
captured at entry, so on an unchanged host every write is a no-op and the
policy the operator invoked the probe on is what survives. An earlier version
wrote a hardcoded Block/Allow there, which silently and permanently rewrote
the policy of any host whose profiles differed, and did so BEFORE -Execute
captured its "pre-state" - making the restored-verbatim claim unachievable on
exactly the hardened hosts that most needed it. The capture therefore happens
before the watchdogs are armed, and is the single source of truth for the
recovery body, the normal teardown and the emergency path alike.

Proving fires the SHIPPED recovery body rather than a rule-only stand-in on
purpose: a failsafe proven by proxy is not proven.

-Execute (the real probe): requires a clean -DryRun first. Re-launches
itself DETACHED (Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden) before anything
destructive, so losing the driving SSH session the instant
BlockAllOutbound goes live cannot interrupt the measure-then-teardown
sequence. Reconnect afterwards and read the transcript path this prints.

Idempotency: refuses to start at all if the session isn't elevated, or if
any `YuzuQuarantine_*` rule or `YuzuQuarantine_Watchdog_*` task already
exists - a second run against a dirty host ABORTS rather than layering
rules (clean up by hand, or just re-run -DryRun, which never locks anything).

Physical-path requirement (do not weaken this): the load-bearing whitelisted
measurement MUST be an address reachable over a physical NIC (gateway or
LAN peer), never the Tailscale 100.64.0.0/10 overlay - Windows Firewall
filters the WireGuard/DERP transport on the physical adapter same as
anything else, so a failed 100.x connection after BlockAllOutbound proves
only "the unwhitelisted tunnel transport got blocked," not the precedence
question. braga's address (-BragaTailscaleAddress) is whitelisted and
measured for convenience only; its result is always INFORMATIONAL and never
feeds the verdict. No physical target resolvable => no verdict (INCONCLUSIVE)
- see Resolve-PhysicalTargets.

Exit codes: 0 completed, teardown verified clean (verdict may still be
INCONCLUSIVE - a valid outcome, not a failure). 1 unhandled exception
(emergency cleanup attempted). 2 preflight refused to start; nothing was
touched. 3 a watchdog proving run failed; aborted before any Block rule,
cleanup attempted. 4 post-run verification found residue - HOST MAY NEED
MANUAL ATTENTION, said loudly on purpose.

Manual recovery if reading this because something went wrong (any admin
PowerShell on the box, e.g. a console/RDP session that doesn't depend on
the blocked network - or just wait: the watchdogs self-clear within
5 / 15 minutes of being armed, unattended):
