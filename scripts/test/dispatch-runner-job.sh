#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dispatch-runner-job.sh — shared helper for dispatching a workflow on a
# self-hosted runner, polling until the run completes, and downloading its
# artifacts into a cache directory. Consumed by:
#
#   - scripts/test/sanitizer-gate.sh   (PR2) → sanitizer-tests.yml on yuzu-wsl2-linux
#   - scripts/test/test-ota-fetch-windows-binary.sh (PR3) → build-windows-agent.yml
#
# The gates treat runner unavailability as WARN (not FAIL) so the rest of
# the /test run can proceed. This script exits:
#
#   0  success (workflow completed successfully, artifacts downloaded)
#   1  hard error (malformed args, gh missing, workflow doesn't exist)
#   2  workflow ran but failed (caller should mark FAIL)
#   3  runner unavailable / dispatch timed out (caller should mark WARN)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/test/dispatch-runner-job.sh \
#       --workflow sanitizer-tests.yml \
#       --ref "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
#       --out-dir "$ART_DIR" \
#       [--inputs '{"suite":"asan"}'] \
#       [--timeout-minutes 60] \
#       [--poll-seconds 30] \
#       [--expect-runner yuzu-wsl2-linux]
#
# Behaviour notes:
#
# 1. The workflow must exist in the current branch's .github/workflows/.
#    We don't upload-the-workflow-first; the operator is expected to have
#    pushed the workflow file ahead of time. For dev iterations,
#    `--ref $(git rev-parse HEAD)` targets the commit under test.
#
# 2. `gh run list` + `gh run view` is the polling mechanism. We match the
#    run by its created_at timestamp crossing the dispatch threshold AND
#    the workflow name, so concurrent dispatches of the same workflow
#    don't confuse each other. The matched run ID is then cached in
#    $OUT_DIR/.run-id for idempotent re-polling.
#
# 3. Timeouts: default 60 minutes total (--timeout-minutes) with 30s
#    polls (--poll-seconds). The "queued" state counts against the
#    timeout — if the runner is offline, the dispatch sits queued and
#    eventually times out, which surfaces as exit 3 (WARN).
#
# 4. Artifacts: every artifact on the completed run is downloaded via
#    `gh run download` into --out-dir. The caller is responsible for
#    parsing the layout (they know what their workflow uploaded).

# scan forward for a NEW run whose createdAt is strictly greater than the
# dispatch moment AND whose headSha matches our target ref. Using both
# filters (timestamp + headSha) makes the discovery robust against
# concurrent dispatches of the same workflow by other operators/CI
# (UP-14 / hp-B2 / qa-N3 race fix).

# internally, but the run list JSON reports the SHA, so we need ours too.
#
# sec-h-2: strictly resolve via git rev-parse. If resolution fails we
# do NOT fall back to echoing $REF verbatim — an unresolvable ref
