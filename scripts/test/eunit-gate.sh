#!/usr/bin/env bash
# eunit-gate.sh — wrap rebar3 eunit so the gate distinguishes "actual test
# failure" from "rebar3 returns 1 because EUnit emitted 'One or more tests
# were cancelled'".
#
# Background (#1005): rebar3 eunit reports cancellations as a process-exit
# error even when every test that ran passed. Cancellations have multiple
# causes:
#   * EUnit's --dir discovery encounters a non-test module like
#     `yuzu_gw_perf_helpers` (no test_/0 exports).
#   * A flake (registry_tests gen_server timeout under VM pollution) aborts
#     a test set partway through.
# Neither case is a regression we want to block a `/test` run on. This
# wrapper exits 0 iff EUnit's summary line says `Failed: 0` AND at least one
# test EXECUTED. Real failures (Failed: N > 0), infrastructure errors (no
# summary line) and zero-executed runs propagate as non-zero. The executed
# check matters because a set-up that crashes in EVERY module prints
# `Failed: 0.  Skipped: 0.  Passed: 0.` plus "One or more tests were
# cancelled" -- an all-cancelled run that would otherwise read as a pass
# (the #4800 false-green class; scripts/test_gateway.py applies the same rule
# via scripts/gateway_test_summary.py).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/test/eunit-gate.sh [extra rebar3 args...]
#
# The wrapper sets REBAR_BASE_DIR for parallel-safety per the SKILL.md
# convention and cd's into gateway/. Pass-through args go to rebar3 eunit
# (e.g. --module=foo,bar) — default is `--dir apps/yuzu_gw/test`.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — EUnit ran, Failed: 0, and >= 1 test executed (passed, even if some
#       sets were cancelled)
#   1 — EUnit ran and Failed: >0, OR no summary line found, OR 0 tests
#       executed (real failure)
#   2 — toolchain or invocation error (rebar3 or python3 missing, gateway/
#       missing, capture file unreadable)

# shows tests passed (cancelled sets, #1005); the Meson gate stays strict.
