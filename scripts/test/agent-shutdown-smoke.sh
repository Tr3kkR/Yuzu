#
# Graceful-shutdown smoke test for the agent. Needs NO server and no Postgres.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Nothing in the unit suites, the integration script, or CI failed if graceful shutdown broke
# completely. scripts/integration-test.sh kills agents in an EXIT trap (kill -> sleep 1 ->
# kill -9) and never asserts an exit code. Several shutdown defects shipped and were caught only
# by a human sending a signal by hand:
#   * pipe2(O_CLOEXEC|O_NONBLOCK) set O_NONBLOCK on BOTH ends, so the watcher's read() returned
#     EAGAIN, the thread exited, and SIGTERM silently stopped being graceful. Nothing LOOKED
#     broken -- the process still died, via the default disposition.
#   * a nested lock_guard self-deadlocked Agent::stop(): the agent hung on EVERY SIGTERM while
#     the unit suites and TSan stayed green.
#   * the signal handlers were installed even when the watcher failed to start, which SWALLOWED
#     the signal and left the agent unkillable by SIGTERM.
#   * Register had no deadline and no cancellable context, so against a server that accepted TCP
#     and never answered, SIGTERM cancelled everything EXCEPT the RPC main was parked in.
#
# THREE RULES, all learned the hard way
# -------------------------------------
# 1. WAIT FOR RUN-LOOP ENTRY, don't just sleep. If the agent is still booting, run()'s ScopeExit
#    performs the teardown and the ShutdownWatcher is never exercised -- the test would pass
#    while the signal path is dead.
#
# 2. EVERY ASSERTION MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL. This file has now twice contained an assertion that
#    could not. First it took a single expected code and RE-RAN the case with the opposite
#    expectation on mismatch (a broken escalation failed run 1, passed run 2, reported PASS).
#    Then it accepted the SET {0,1} for the escalation case -- and BOTH members were reachable by
#    a defect: a broken escalation exits 0, and a since-deferred shutdown deadline also exited 1.
#    An assertion that accepts the failure mode is a green light wired to the bug.
#    (governance: quality-engineer, twice.)
#
# 3. A TIMEOUT MUST BE JUSTIFIED AGAINST A MEASURED BASELINE. An earlier harness called the agent
#    "hung" if it was still alive 7-8s after SIGTERM -- while a healthy shutdown took 8.6s. Every
#    slow-but-correct shutdown scored as a permanent wedge, and a whole phantom bug (root cause,
#    repro, proposed fix) was built on top of it. "Still alive after N seconds" is a hang ONLY if
#    N exceeds the known-good time.
#
# MEASURED BASELINE -- re-measured on THIS rig, 2026-07-14, on the branch head, because a number
# you inherited is not a number you measured (Linux, idle, 49 plugins):
#     run loop, dead port, single SIGTERM ............ 3-4s    (n=5)
#     parked in Register vs a BLACK-HOLE server ...... 8-9s    (n=4; 18.0s BEFORE the Register fix)
#     second-signal escalation ....................... ~1s     (n=4)
#
# NOTE: an earlier note in this file claimed 3.0s for the black-hole case. It does not reproduce
# here -- the honest figure on this rig is 8-9s, and the bound below is set against THAT, not
# against the inherited number. The fix it proves is still enormous (18.0s -> 8.5s), and the bound
# still discriminates: 15s sits well below the 18.0s regression and well above the 9s healthy case.
#
# HANG_TIMEOUT is 30s -- above every one of those. It is a HANG DETECTOR, not a latency assertion.
# The per-case latency bounds below ARE latency assertions and are set individually.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* COVER, so nobody reads a pass as more than it is: the agent never
# REGISTERS here, so the heartbeat / OTA / daily-sync threads (spawned only after a successful
# Register) never exist. A connected agent's teardown is longer -- 0.5-8.5s measured. Do not quote
# these numbers as production shutdown latency. (governance: consistency-auditor.)
# Also NOT covered: the PID-1 hard-exit posture (main.cpp on_signal_hard_exit) -- this harness
# never runs the agent as pid 1, and neither does any CI leg, so the pid-1 discard semantics
# the fallback exists for are verified by inspection only. (governance gate round: QE-4.)

# The second-signal escalation leaves without unwinding via _exit(1) / TerminateProcess(...,1), so

# BUT 1 IS NOW OVERLOADED THREE WAYS, AND THE OLD SCOPING ARGUMENT HERE WAS FALSE. It used to say
# "every case reaches the run loop, and a startup failure never does, so a 1 can only be the
# escalation". Both halves broke: a reconnect-path thread-pool exhaustion now sets startup_failed
# from INSIDE the run loop, and -- worse for this suite -- a watcher that fails to CONSTRUCT (fd
# pressure, i.e. exactly a loaded 4-runner shared box) installs a degrade handler that exits 1 on
# the FIRST signal. In that state a COMPLETELY BROKEN escalation would still exit 1 and case 2
# would go green for the wrong reason: a green light wired to the bug, which is rule 2 of this
# file's own header, violated by a later commit.
