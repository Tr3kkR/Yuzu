"""check-seam-closure.py - per-family INCLUDE-CLOSURE seam-enforcement gate
(ADR-0031 migration step 3, WS-A4 item 1).

ADR-0031's migration step 3 requires that a family's presentation/handler
translation units do NOT reach a data store directly - they call the
in-process API instead. This script is the first per-family scaffold for that
rule (issue tracked under the /split control plane's WS-A4 item 1); today it
covers nine families — `network`, `verify`, `compliance`, `device`, `dex`,
`dex_perf`, `schedule`, `workflow`, `guardian` (see FAMILIES below; this
docstring previously read "five", already stale by `dex_perf` before the
`schedule` family was added, then stale again at "seven" once `workflow`
landed, then again at "eight" once `guardian` landed — corrected here each
time, not merely for the family that caught it).

WHAT THIS IS: a sound-for-its-stated-claim INCLUDE-CLOSURE check, NOT a full
static analysis and NOT a substitute for review. The enforceable proxy for
"this translation unit does not touch a store" is: the TRANSITIVE `#include`
closure of the TU contains no store header. To call `store->method()` the
class definition has to be VISIBLE via some include, so if no header in the
closure defines a store class, the TU cannot be calling into one directly.
That implication only breaks two ways, both ACKNOWLEDGED and NOT caught here:

  1. A COMPUTED / macro-built include (`#include SOME_MACRO`, X-macro headers,
     `#define STORE_HEADER "foo_store.hpp"` + `#include STORE_HEADER`) - the
     literal filename this script's regex extracts would not be the real
     target, or there would be no filename to extract at all.
  2. A translation unit that hand-re-declares a store class's body (or a
     subset of its member signatures) locally instead of including its real
     header - the closure walk never sees the real header because the code
     never asked for it, yet the call still resolves at link time.

Neither shape exists in any family this script covers today; if one is ever
introduced, this check will pass while the seam is actually broken. That is a
known, stated gap - not a silent one.

ABSTRACT-VS-LOCAL SEAM (#4249): the fourth forbidden pattern,
`*_api_local.hpp`, is NOT a store-layer header - it is the CORE-ONLY half of
a family's in-process API. #4249 splits `network_api.hpp` into the ABSTRACT
interface (what a presentation TU is allowed to call) and a new
`network_api_local.hpp` holding the store-backed FACTORY
(`make_local_network_api`) that wires that interface up to real stores. The
local header deliberately carries NO store `#include`s of its own - only
forward declarations - so the three store patterns above CANNOT see a
presentation TU that wrongly includes it, and the abstract/local boundary
would be convention only. Naming the local header itself is what makes the
boundary enforced rather than advisory. WHAT IT CATCHES: any enforced family
TU (route / renderer / model / the abstract API header) that reaches a
`*_api_local.hpp` anywhere in its include closure - i.e. a presentation TU
helping itself to the store-backed factory instead of receiving the abstract
interface. It is NOT a ban on the header existing or being used: `server.cpp`
(core wiring), the family's own `*_api.cpp` implementation, and the tests all
include it legitimately, and none of those is in any family's enforced TU
set. The local header ITSELF, however, IS in the family's enforced TU set:
a TU is excluded from its own include closure (closure() seeds `seen` with
the TU), so it never self-matches this pattern, and enforcing it makes its
own purity (forward declarations only, zero store `#include`s) lint-checked
rather than review-only. Being an include-closure check, this pattern
carries exactly the SAME acknowledged escape as shape 2 above, in the same
class and for the same reason: a presentation TU that hand-re-declares the
factory's signature locally instead of including the header still links,
and this script will never see it. Two further NAME-LEVEL escapes are
inherent to a basename glob and are stated here so the whole escape list
lives in one place: a core-only factory header that is not literally named
`*_api_local.hpp` (the template prescribes that name for every family), and
the `.hpp`-only / case-sensitive match (a `.h`/`.hxx` or differently-cased
spelling is not caught; the tree has neither). Known and stated, not silent.

INCLUDE RESOLUTION: this project spells project-internal, cross-component
headers `<yuzu/...>` (server/core/meson.build's own
`include_directories(['include', '../../common/include'])`), so ANGLE
BRACKETS ARE NOT A RELIABLE "this is third-party, never a store" SIGNAL here -
`server/core/include/yuzu/server/scim_store.hpp` is a real store header
reachable via `#include <yuzu/server/scim_store.hpp>`. A checker that only
followed quote-includes would treat that as an unwatched escape hatch, on top
of the two above. This script therefore follows BOTH quote and angle
includes, resolving each one against the project's actual include roots
(mirroring the compiler's own quote-then-search-path / angle-search-path
distinction - see `resolve_include()`); an angle-bracket spelling that does
not resolve inside `server/core/include` or `common/include` is treated as a
genuine external/system/vendored header (the C++ stdlib, httplib, spdlog,
libpq-fe, ...), which by construction cannot define one of this project's own
store classes, so treating it as opaque there is sound.

FAMILY COVERAGE: today this checks nine families — `network`, `verify`, `compliance`,
`device`, `dex`, `dex_perf`, `schedule`, `workflow` and `guardian` — each contributing its dashboard/UI, REST-route (or seamed routes)
and model translation units, plus the abstract in-process API header and (since
#4249) the core-only `*_api_local.hpp` factory header. The exact per-family TU
set is the FAMILIES dict below. Each family's REST-handler TWIN registrations
live inside `rest_api_v1.cpp` (or the family's own routes TU), and its MCP-tool
twin inside `mcp_server.cpp` - BOTH are
multi-family translation units that legitimately hold real store access for
~20 OTHER families each. An include-closure check applied to either whole
file would trivially fail (or be gamed by scoping) and would say nothing
meaningful about a given family specifically. Those two files' per-family
sections are therefore INSPECTED-NOT-ENFORCED - reviewed by hand today, not
gated by this script - until a block-scoped or symbol-scoped successor
exists. Do not read a clean run of this script as covering them.

# Evidence (see the PR description / junior report for the exact commands):
#   - `ls server/core/src/*_store.hpp` -> 43 files, every server store header
#     in the tree (device_store.hpp, quarantine_store.hpp, ... including
#     `server/core/include/yuzu/server/scim_store.hpp` by BASENAME match -
#     `*_store.hpp` matches regardless of which directory the header lives
#     under, which is what closes the angle-bracket `<yuzu/server/
#     scim_store.hpp>` escape noted in the module docstring above).
#   - `agent_registry.hpp` (server/core/src/agent_registry.hpp) is the
#     in-process agent/device registry - not named `*_store.hpp` but is the
#     same class of direct-data-access surface a presentation TU must not
#     reach past the seam.
#   - `server/core/src/pg/*.hpp` (pg_pool.hpp, pg_exec.hpp, pg_raii.hpp,
#     pg_migration_runner.hpp, pg_retention_guard.hpp, pg_array.hpp,
#     pg_session_advisory_lock.hpp, secret_codec.hpp) is the shared
#     Postgres-connection/raw-SQL layer EVERY store is built on
#     (`PgPool`, `PQexecParams`-wrapping `exec_param`/`exec_params`,
#     `PgResult`/`PgConn` RAII) - a TU that includes one of these can issue
#     raw SQL against the pool directly, bypassing any store class entirely,
#     which the `*_store.hpp` pattern alone would not catch.
#   - `*_api_local.hpp` (#4249) is the ONLY non-store pattern here: it
#     enforces the ABSTRACT-vs-LOCAL seam boundary within a family's own
#     in-process API. The local header declares the store-backed factory
#     (`make_local_network_api`) but holds only FORWARD DECLARATIONS of the
#     stores it wires, so the three patterns above are blind to it - a
#     presentation TU including it would reach the factory with a clean
#     store closure. It is legitimately included by `server.cpp` (core
#     wiring), by the family's own `*_api.cpp` implementation, and by tests
#     - none of which is in any family's enforced TU set - but NEVER by a
#     route / renderer / model TU, which is exactly what this pattern gates.
#     See the module docstring's "ABSTRACT-VS-LOCAL SEAM" section for the

#   - store/infra CLASS names the "Store" suffix misses: `AuthDB`, `AgentRegistry`,
#     `ExecutionTracker`, `PgPool` — data/identity/registry/pool types that must
#     never surface in an abstract seam header (some, e.g. auth_db.hpp /

#     name probe is their only guard). Added per the #4582 Fable review; verified

#   - `AppPerfFleetRow` (from app_perf_fleet_store.hpp) — the DexPerfApi seam's own
#     raw B2 store row. It carries per-`(version,day)` histogram arrays the
#     `kDexCohortFloor` suppression must apply to BEFORE anything crosses the

#     `AppPerfDailyRow` and `AppPerfFleetRow` — the two row types a floor/audit
#     gate must interpose on BEFORE crossing — stay store-side and denylisted.
# This is a hand-maintained denylist (a new such type is a manual add) — the

# NOT listed: `AppPerfCohortRow`, a PURE comparison type in `app_perf_compare.hpp`

# Five families so far: `network` (WS-A4 item 1's pilot), `verify` (WS-A4
# #4250, the SECOND family), `compliance` (the THIRD, #4337), `device`
# (the FOURTH, #4484) and `dex` (the FIFTH — the DEX signals seam). Each set
# covers the
# presentation-side TUs plus BOTH halves of the seam header pair: the
# abstract `*_api.hpp` and the core-only `*_api_local.hpp` (#4249). Enforcing
# the local header pins its own purity (forward decls only); it cannot
# self-match `*_api_local.hpp` because a TU is excluded from its own closure.
# A declared-but-missing TU is a hard error - see `check_family()`.
#
# `verify`'s closure was NOT clean before #4250's rewire: `verify_routes.hpp`
# used to include `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` (for the retired `AppPerfCohortFn`)
# AND `dex_routes.hpp` (for `DexRoutes::AuditFn`) - the latter transitively
# reaches `dex_app_perf_ui.hpp` -> `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` regardless, which
# itself `#include`s `app_perf_daily_store.hpp` + `app_perf_fleet_store.hpp`
# (both `*_store.hpp`). The rewire (1) replaced the cohort provider with the
# `VerifyApi` seam, (2) relocated the pure `app_perf_param_valid`/
# `kAppPerfParamCap` validator out of `dex_app_perf_model.hpp` into the
# already-pure `app_perf_compare.hpp`, and (3) defined `VerifyRoutes::AuditFn`
# LOCALLY (same shape as `DexRoutes::AuditFn`/`NetworkRoutes::AuditFn`)
# instead of borrowing `dex_routes.hpp` for one type alias - which is what
# actually makes this family's closure clean, not merely dropping one include.
