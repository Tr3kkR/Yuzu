"""check-api-parity.py - F1 ledger conformance gate for the ADR-0031/#2146
REST/MCP/dashboard parity programme (issue #3991).

ADR-0031 INV-31-4 requires that every capability the dashboard exposes is
also reachable through the versioned REST API (and, per ADR-1005, through
MCP). Nobody has ever verified this mechanically: `openapi_spec()`
(server/core/src/rest_api_v1.cpp) is a hand-typed literal that the file's
own comment admits can under-report the live route table. This script is
the machine-checked backstop `docs/adr/0031-presentation-core-engine-
decomposition.md` calls "a deliverable of migration step 3" (INV-31-4) and
the unit-test half's sibling - `tests/unit/server/
test_openapi_spec_completeness.cpp` covers the in-process half for
`rest_api_v1.cpp` alone; this script is the exhaustive, whole-tree half.

WHAT THIS IS: a LEXICAL TRIPWIRE, NOT A PROOF. It regex-extracts route
registrations, the OpenAPI literal, and the MCP tool table as plain text -
it does not parse C++ and cannot see through indirection (a route
registered via a helper function that itself calls `sink.Get(...)`, a path
built from a runtime variable, a tool added through anything other than a
`kTools[]` array literal). A fully general version needs a type-aware /
clang-based approach - see #2572, which is the type-aware successor to the
sibling `scripts/ci/check-inline-route-registrations.py` lexical gate this
script's technique is modeled on (same general approach - regex extraction
+ a monotonic ratchet baseline - applied to a different question: REST/MCP/
OpenAPI/fragment parity, not inline-vs-sink route registration style).

FUTURE HOME: this ledger + gate is a deliberate STOPGAP. ADR-0032 interlock
(j) / issue #2678 will eventually generate the capability projection this
script hand-extracts; when that lands, this script becomes (or is replaced
by) the diff harness that compares the generated projection against the
served surface, rather than parsing source text by hand. Nothing here
competes with that work - see docs/api-parity-ledger.md's prose header.

WHAT IT CHECKS
  1. Every `/fragments/*` or unversioned `/api/*` route registered anywhere
     under server/core/src/*.cpp has a corresponding row in exactly one
     scripts/ci/api-parity/<domain>.json ledger file, keyed by (method,
     canonical path - see `canonicalize()`).
  2. Every ledger row whose status is "twinned" names a `rest_v1_twin`
     and/or `mcp_twin` that actually exists in the CURRENT extraction (a
     twin claim referencing a renamed/removed route or tool is a lie, and
     this catches it going stale).
  3. Every registered `/api/v1/*` route either appears in the OpenAPI
     `paths` table (openapi_spec() in rest_api_v1.cpp) or is named in this
     script's ALLOWLIST_OPENAPI_MISSING with a reason. F2's job is to
     shrink that allowlist to zero, not to add to it.
  4. The RATCHET: the total count of ledger rows whose status is not
     "twinned" ("untwinned") must not exceed BASELINE_UNTWINNED below. Like
     check-capability-matrix.sh's ratchet, this is BIDIRECTIONAL - an
     improvement (count decreases) must lower the constant in the same
     change, or a later regression back up to the old baseline would pass
     silently.

# carries one of those non-"twinned" statuses (a `composed-of` or
# `exception` row is never expected to flip to "twinned" - it is a
# deliberate, reviewed classification, not a backlog item) - "0 untwinned"
# is not this gate's success criterion, "no regression from the reviewed
# baseline" is. May SHRINK as F2+ wires real REST/MCP twins and flips
# `planned` rows to "twinned"; may never GROW. Lower this in the SAME change
