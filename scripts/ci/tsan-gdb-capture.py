"""tsan-gdb-capture.py — multi-binary gdb stack capture for the TSan nightly (#1038).

The nightly TSan job's diagnostic step used to gdb a single hardcoded binary
(`./tests/yuzu_server_tests`), so a crash in yuzu_agent_tests, yuzu_tar_tests or
yuzu_transport_tests captured no stack at all (#1038, R-06). This derives the
binaries to inspect from the run itself and appends every capture to one file.

Two entry paths, matching the two ways the TSan job can end badly:

  failure   — `meson test` ran to completion and something failed. The failing
              meson entries come from meson-logs/testlog.junit.xml; each maps back
              to its binary + args through `meson introspect --tests`, using the
              same longest-substring contract flake-retry.py already relies on.
              That mapping is IMPORTED from flake-retry.py rather than
              re-implemented, so the two cannot drift; tests/meson.build documents
              the naming constraint the sharded server entries must keep for it to
              hold, and the selftest below fails loudly if the import ever breaks.

  cancelled — the job hit its 60-minute timeout, i.e. a test hung. That is exactly
              the case a stack helps most (#1038, NICE-3), but meson never got to
              write testlog.junit.xml, so there is no failure list to read. What we
              do know: an entry that FINISHED has a section in testlog.txt. The
              stuck entry is therefore among the introspected Catch2 entries with no
              section. We replay those candidates (bounded — see BUDGETS) and let
              gdb's SIGINT interrupt dump the hung thread stacks.

Catch2 shuffles case order per run, so a replay only reproduces the original
interleaving if it re-uses that run's seed — parsed per-entry from that entry's own
testlog.txt section, not globally (a global grep would staple the first binary's
seed onto every other binary, R-06's "extract per-binary seed").

Best-effort by contract. This only ever runs when the job is ALREADY failing or
cancelled, so every internal error degrades to a note in the capture file and
exit 0: a diagnostic must never mask the real failure, nor invent a second one.

    `--signal=INT` is what makes the cancelled/hang path produce anything: on a
    plain SIGTERM gdb dies and we capture nothing, whereas SIGINT interrupts the
    *inferior*, `run` returns, and gdb goes on to execute the backtrace commands
    below. --kill-after guarantees we still exit if gdb itself wedges.

    Program args go through `--args`, and we deliberately DO NOT touch
    `startup-with-shell`. That pairing is load-bearing and not obvious:

      gdb builds the inferior's argument string at `--args` PARSE time, escaping
      shell metacharacters (`~[pg]` is stored as `\\~\\[pg\\]` — `show args` will
      tell you so) on the assumption that its startup shell will unescape them
      again on the way to execve. Escaping and shell are one mechanism, not two.
      Turning the shell off while still using `--args` therefore breaks the
      round-trip and the inferior receives the BACKSLASHES: verified on gdb 15.1
      (Ubuntu 24.04) — argv[1] came through as `5c 7e 5c 5b 70 67 5c 5d`, i.e.
      literally `\\~\\[pg\\]`. gdb 17.1 (Ubuntu 26.04, the current Big Tam image)
      happens to unescape anyway, which is exactly what makes this the nastiest
      class of bug: a diagnostic that silently replays the WRONG Catch2 shard, and
      reports its no-repro with total confidence, on any runner with an older gdb.

    So: keep the shell, let gdb escape and the shell unescape, and the tag spec
    arrives byte-identical (`7e 5b 70 67 5d`) on both gdb 15.1 and 17.1. The
    escaping also means the shell never globs `[pg]` against the cwd. `_selftest`
    asserts this end-to-end against a real gdb wherever one exists, rather than
    trusting the Python list — asserting the list is what let this through."""

    our argv list and execve, and an earlier version of this script delivered
    `\\~\\[pg\\]` to Catch2 while every list-level assertion still passed. The only
    honest test of "the shard filter survives" is to look at what the process
    actually got.

    FAIL-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION: this asserts a failure ONLY when it positively
    observes the mangling. Every way gdb can fail to run cleanly — absent, wrong
    OS, can't attach (macOS Homebrew gdb without codesigning; a restrictive
    ptrace_scope), times out, emits no ARGV line — is a SKIP, never a failure. It
    must be safe to have in the `docs` suite that gates every PR on Linux, Windows
    AND macOS: a green environment that merely lacks a working gdb must not turn
    the suite red. Its teeth are live exactly where a working gdb exists — the TSan
    nightly (which installs gdb) and any local Linux/Docker run — which is exactly
    where the capture itself runs. The universal regression guard is the pure-logic
    `set startup-with-shell off not in argv` assertion above; this is the empirical
    belt-and-suspenders on top of it."""
