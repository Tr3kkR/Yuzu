# check-plugin-capture-os-guard.sh — regression test for the cross-OS capture
# certification blocker (PR #4112 review): tools/plugin-capture must reject a
# --os that does not match the platform it was actually compiled for, rather
# than silently certifying a wrong-platform sample as truth.
#
# Usage:
#   check-plugin-capture-os-guard.sh <BUILDDIR>
#
# BUILDDIR is the meson build directory (e.g. build-linux-gcc-15-debug). Run
# AFTER `meson compile` — the plugin-capture binary must already exist. No
# plugin library is loaded: the --os check runs during argument validation,
# strictly before any library is opened, so a nonexistent path is enough.
