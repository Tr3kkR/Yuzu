# check-plugin-spawn-lexical.sh -- Decision-10a per-PR lexical spawn gate
# (docs/adr/3002-acquisition-ladder.md:459-488).
#
# A zero-cost, no-build text scan (the check-compose-versions.sh pattern)
# that fails a PR introducing a raw process-spawn token in agents/plugins/*
# or agents/core -- outside the registered allowlist below -- rather than
# going through the shared, sanctioned runner
# (yuzu::agent::run_bounded_subprocess, agents/core/src/subprocess_runner.cpp).
# This is tier (a) of the ADR's two-tier enforcement; CodeQL (tier b,
# scheduled, call-identity-aware) is the deep net this cannot be -- see the
# ADR for why neither tier alone is sufficient.
#
# Token semantics are pinned exactly as the ADR specifies:
#   * word-boundary matching, so a raw token never matches as a substring of
#     a longer identifier (`subsystem(` must never trip on `system`);
#   * the exec family is enumerated BY NAME, never a glob -- a bare `exec*`
#     would match every plugin's own `execute(` method. `execve`, `fexecve`,
#     and `execveat` are ALSO enumerated here, beyond the ADR's original
#     literal list -- this PR's own runner work (A5's explicit envp, B6's
#     TOCTOU-safe exec) introduces real calls to them, and leaving them out
#     would let a plugin call raw execve() and never trip the gate;
#   * `system`/`fork`/`posix_spawn`/`popen`/`_popen` as bounded whole words;
#   * the Windows family spelled out (`CreateProcess*`, `ShellExecute*`,
#     `_spawn*`/`_wspawn*`);
#   * a token only counts as a hit when it looks like a CALL (`token(`),
#     narrowing (not eliminating -- see the comment/string stripper below)
#     prose false positives.
#
# Two allowlist tiers, both by FILE (see the ADR's "exceptions by call
# identity, never by file" -- the per-call-identity mechanism is the sink
# manifest, docs/agent-spawn-sink-manifest.md, population tracked separately
# in #2380 and out of this PR's scope; a coarser file-level allowlist is the
# honest state this lexical-only gate can enforce today without that
# manifest):
#   1. RUNNER_ALLOWLIST -- the ONE canonical, permanent, ADR-sanctioned
#      allowlist entry: the runner's own implementation. A second file
#      forking/exec'ing/CreateProcess'ing directly is exactly the "scattered
#      copies" this ADR exists to prevent -- route through the runner
#      instead of adding a second entry here.
#   2. GRANDFATHERED -- pre-existing, NOT-YET-MIGRATED call sites (migration
#      sequencing is a separate roadmap concern, not this ADR's or this
#      script's job -- see fork_lock.hpp's own residual ledger). Frozen as of
#      this PR so a full-tree run is green against the CURRENT codebase
#      instead of failing on ~40 known, already-accepted sites the migration
#      hasn't reached yet; a NEW site in a file not already on this list
#      still fails the gate. Removing an entry as a site migrates onto the
#      runner is expected and welcome.
#
# KNOWN tier-(a) LIMIT -- context/relocation blindness (GF-loc, CDX-R5-01):
# the grandfathered base-vs-head diff compares CALL IDENTITY (token + argument
# bytes, see find_calls). It CANNOT see a change that leaves a call's text
# identical but alters its CONTEXT -- relocating an unchanged spawn into a
# reachable path, removing a guarding `if`, or activating a dormant `#if 0`
# call. ADR-3002 Decision 1 (3002-acquisition-ladder.md:368-372) states the
# Decision-10 lexical gate "cannot see" routed-data/context attacks and that
# the REVIEW-ENFORCED freeze rule closes that window; Decision 10 scopes this
# gate as tier (a) "plain-text", with scheduled CodeQL as the tier (b) deep
# net. The function-granular stable-site-ID mechanism (`<plugin>/<function>#<n>`)
# that would catch relocation is the sink manifest (#2380), out of this PR's
# scope. So a reviewer of a GRANDFATHERED-file diff must not treat a green gate
# as proof a legacy spawn's reachability is unchanged -- read the diff.
#
# A second tier-(a) residual (K-R6-02): the call signature normalizes
# inter-token whitespace and emits punctuators as single-char tokens, so a
# whitespace-sensitive maximal-munch REGROUPING inside a frozen call's arguments
# -- `argv[a+++b]` -> `argv[a+ ++b]`, or `x && y` -> `x & &y` -- changes the
# runtime value while reading as a pure reflow. No grandfathered call currently
# contains such an adjacency (verified), so this is a theoretical residual of
# the same tier-(a) lexical class delegated to review + CodeQL.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/check-plugin-spawn-lexical.sh              # scan the real tree
#   scripts/ci/check-plugin-spawn-lexical.sh --selftest    # fixture self-test
