#
# Verify the healthcheck RUNTIME INVARIANTS of the Yuzu application images (#751).
#
# The composes healthcheck these containers with a probe that depends on a tool
# baked into the image, not on the application:
#
#   Dockerfile.server         bash + /dev/tcp + grep   (apt-installed bash)
#   Dockerfile.gateway        wget --spider            (alpine busybox, on PATH)
#   Dockerfile.server.chisel  /bin/busybox wget --spider
#   Dockerfile.gateway.chisel /bin/busybox wget --spider
#   Dockerfile.agent.chisel   /bin/busybox wget --spider   (see PRE-EMPTIVE below)
#
# KEEP IN SYNC. The probes below are a hard-coded COPY of the healthcheck
# commands in these files. If you change a healthcheck there, change the probe
# here -- otherwise this gate goes on proving the OLD command and reports green
# while the real healthcheck is broken. The workflow's `changes` filter lists the
# same set, so an edit to any of them forces this gate to run:
#
#   docker-compose.uat.yml (root)                    server: bash /dev/tcp + grep '200 OK'
#   deploy/docker/docker-compose.uat.yml             gateway: wget --spider
#   deploy/docker/docker-compose.demo.yml            server/gateway-chisel: /bin/busybox wget
#   deploy/docker/docker-compose.reference.yml       server: bash /dev/tcp (connect-only)
#   deploy/docker/docker-compose.reference-gateway.yml  server: bash /dev/tcp
#   deploy/docker/docker-compose.viz-uat.yml         server: bash /dev/tcp + head + grep
#   scripts/test/docker-compose.upgrade-test.yml     server: bash /dev/tcp + grep
#   .github/workflows/pre-release.yml (3 heredocs)   server: bash /dev/tcp
#
# NOT COVERED, deliberately:
#   - yuzu-postgres is also published and also healthchecked (pg_isready + psql
#     via CMD-SHELL), but it is FROM postgres:* and those tools are the image's
#     entire reason to exist, so the invariant is not at risk in the same way.
#     It has no role here and no pre-push gate in docker-publish-postgres.
#   - agent-chisel is PRE-EMPTIVE: no compose healthchecks any agent image today.
#     The busybox invariant is gated anyway so the demo stack can gain an agent
#     healthcheck later without a silent break.
#
# Those dependencies are invisible to the application and to every test we run:
# a base-image swap (trixie-slim -> a variant without bash), a dropped apt
# package, or a chisel slice change that stops shipping the busybox symlink
# breaks nothing at build time and nothing at boot. It breaks only the
# healthcheck -- so Compose parks every container in `unhealthy` forever, and
# anything with `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` never starts. The
# application itself is fine, which is what makes it so easy to ship.
#
# This script is the gate. It runs each image's REAL healthcheck probe against
# a known-good HTTP listener and requires it to succeed.
#
# Why a live listener rather than a bare capability check: the obvious probe --
# connect to a closed port and accept "connection refused" -- cannot tell a
# working bash from a bash built without /dev/tcp. Both exit 1 (a bash without
# net redirections treats /dev/tcp/... as an ordinary missing file). Probing
# against a listener that IS accepting connections collapses that ambiguity:
# exit 0 is the only passing outcome, so a bash that has lost /dev/tcp fails
# here instead of passing.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/verify-healthcheck-invariants.sh <role>=<image> [<role>=<image> ...]
#
# Example:
#   scripts/ci/verify-healthcheck-invariants.sh \
#       server=ghcr.io/tr3kkr/yuzu-server:0.13.0 \
#       gateway-chisel=yuzu-gateway-chisel:ci
#
# Exits non-zero, naming the missing tool, if any invariant is broken.
