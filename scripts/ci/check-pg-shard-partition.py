"""check-pg-shard-partition.py — prove the PG-tagged Catch2 case population is
exactly partitioned across this build's ``server-pg``-suite meson test()
entries: every ``[pg]`` case lands in exactly one shard, none lost, none
duplicated. Also proves the ``server-pg-smoke`` entry (#3443 Phase 2) is a
genuine, bounded, correctly-flagged subset of ``[pg]`` — one entry, the
expected name, the expected exact case count, tagged ``--allow-running-
no-tests``, and every matched case also carries ``[pg]``.

Windows CI test-phase restructuring (#3443, 2026-08-28): the same check_partition()
set-math also proves the ``server-nonpg``-suite entries partition ``~[pg]`` —
the non-pg shards the Windows job's own non-pg Test step selects by suite,
same discovery-by-suite-membership property, same failure shape, reusing
the one chokepoint rather than a second hand-rolled copy.

Replaces flake-retry.py's old verbatim positional-filter pin (a hardcoded
copy of every shard's tag-filter string, hand-updated on every split/
rebalance — missed 3 times in the same number of weeks, each time reddening
CI unconditionally; see tests/meson.build's shard-history comment). That pin
only ever proved the filter strings hadn't silently changed since the last
person to update it looked. This proves the actual property that matters —
exact partitioning of the real case population — against the compiled
binary, not against a remembered snapshot.

Runs as its own meson test() entry (suite: 'server'), NOT inside the cheap
flake-retry selftest (suite: 'docs'): it needs the real yuzu_server_tests
binary built, which the docs suite deliberately does not depend on. No
Postgres connection needed — --list-tests only enumerates registered
TEST_CASE macros, it never executes a test body.

Discovery is via `meson introspect <builddir> --tests`, keyed on suite
membership (yuzu:server-pg), not a hardcoded shard-name list — so a shard
add/split/rebalance needs no update here at all, only a correct suite: kwarg
on the new/changed test() entry in tests/meson.build.

Escape hatch if this checker itself is wrong: revert this file's own
test() block in tests/meson.build ('server pg shard partition invariant',
tests/meson.build's `if build_server` scope — not Linux-only). This is the
one COMPLETE single-edit de-wire: it stops the check on every leg that
builds the server, including Windows and macOS. Removing the
'server pg shard partition invariant' token from ci.yml's Linux
flake-retry.py invocation line (governance Gate 8, sre, #3443) is NOT
equivalent and covers Linux only — the Windows and macOS legs invoke
flake-retry.py with no --suite/name filter at all (it passes straight
through to `meson test`), so they would keep running this test regardless
of that edit. The separate 'check-pg-shard-partition selftest' entry
(suite: 'docs', added alongside test_check_pg_shard_partition.py) is
untouched by either revert and stays running — it exercises only synthetic
fixtures and asserts nothing about real shard state, so it is harmless to
leave in place while this checker itself is being fixed or reverted.

Pure logic (`parse_shard_entries`, `check_partition`) is separated from I/O
(`introspect_tests`, `list_cases`, `main`) specifically so it can be
exercised with synthetic fixtures, no real build or binary needed — see
test_check_pg_shard_partition.py, which follows the same in-process
synthetic-fixture precedent as flake-retry.py's own --selftest (not its
separate fake-PATH-stub subprocess tests) for the same reason: a future
regression in THIS script's own detection logic (not the shards it checks)
should fail a fast, no-build docs-suite test, not require another manual
mutation-test session.
