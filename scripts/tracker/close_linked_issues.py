"""close_linked_issues.py -- close issues that merged dev PRs claim (ADR-3001 A1 par.3-5).

The one driver behind every mode of the close automation. All modes share
closing_refs.py (the single parser) and ONE planning path (build_plan), so the
leak scan can never disagree with the close path it audits.

Modes (default is ALWAYS --dry-run; nothing mutates without --execute):

  --push BEFORE AFTER     workflow mode: close what the PRs merged by this
                          push range claim. Used by close-linked-issues.yml.
  --backfill              one-time #2139 backfill: sweep ALL merged dev PRs,
                          list still-open claimed issues. The dry run writes a
                          plan snapshot (--plan FILE); --execute additionally
                          requires --yes-i-reviewed, the SAME --plan FILE (the
                          run aborts, exit 4, if the live plan drifted from the
                          reviewed snapshot -- PR bodies are editable
                          post-merge, so the diff the maintainer approved is
                          the diff that executes), and --approval-url (the
                          #2139 comment recording per-issue approval; verified
                          to exist with a trusted author, and embedded in
                          every backfill evidence comment). In backfill mode,
                          `security`-labelled candidates are EXCLUDED
                          (printed, never mutated -- not even an advisory):
                          the maintainer reviews them in the diff instead.
  --undo-push BEFORE AFTER  recompute the closure set for an exact prior push
                          range and reopen what THIS automation closed there
                          (verified by its own idempotency marker).
  --leak-scan             completeness backstop: refs in recently-merged PR
                          bodies that would be CLOSED by the ladder right now
                          -- i.e. an earlier run failed. Non-empty => exit 1
                          (the workflow's alert job fires). Shares build_plan,
                          so protected/advisory items are never "leaks".

Decision ladder, order load-bearing (issue-standard.md 5.1; A1 par.4-5):
  cap (>6 refs on one PR => close NOTHING for that PR, plan a cap-skip issue)
  -> 404 -> self-ref -> not-an-issue(PR) -> not-open -> already-marked
  (idempotent, TRUSTED comments only) -> `security` label => ADVISORY (push) /
  EXCLUDED (backfill) -> `do-not-close` label or scripts/tracker/
  do-not-close.txt => ADVISORY -> assigned => ADVISORY -> open linked PR (full
  timeline, no truncation) => ADVISORY -> CLOSE as completed (the state change
  lands FIRST, then the evidence comment, then `fixed-on-dev`, label tolerated
  missing -- comment-first would plant the idempotency marker on a still-open
  issue if the close PATCH failed, blinding every liveness mechanism at once).

Marker idempotency trusts only comments whose author is github-actions[bot]
or whose author_association is OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR -- a drive-by
commenter cannot suppress the automation by pasting a marker (anyone who CAN
plant a trusted marker already has write access and could close directly).

FAIL-CLOSED invariants:
  - scripts/tracker/do-not-close.txt missing or unparseable => the run refuses
    to close ANYTHING (exit 3). A deleted never-close list must never mean
    "nothing is protected". (Also makes this PR safe to merge before/after the
    PR that introduces the file.)
  - planning NEVER mutates: build_plan is read-only; every mutation (closes,
    advisories, cap-skip issues) happens in apply_plan, strictly AFTER the
    security assertions below have passed.
  - backfill hard-stop (A1 par.4): if any `security`-labelled issue holds a
    mutating action in the backfill plan, exit 4 with zero mutations.
  - defense-in-depth (all modes): a CLOSE action still carrying the
    `security` label after the ladder aborts the run, zero mutations, exit 4.
  - compare API truncation (250-commit cap): an over-long push range aborts
    loudly (the alert job fires) instead of silently skipping merged PRs.

GitHub access goes through the `gh` CLI (repo convention -- never raw curl),
authenticated by GH_TOKEN in CI or ambient `gh auth` locally. Mutations are
throttled (MUTATION_SLEEP_S) to stay clear of secondary rate limits.

Stdlib only. Run as `python` on Windows dev boxes (python3 is the Store stub).
