"""Zero-executed guard for the Meson gateway test wrapper (#4800).

The one summary parser for every gateway test gate: imported by
scripts/test_gateway.py (the Meson gate, via require_tests_executed), and run
as a CLI (`cancel-tolerant`) by scripts/test/eunit-gate.sh (/test) and the
release workflow's EUnit step. Pinned by tests/test_gateway_test_summary.py.
Kept in its own module (not inline in the wrapper) because the wrapper runs
rebar3 at import time and so cannot be imported by a test.

#   ct:    "All 52 tests passed."
#          "Failed 6 tests. Skipped 2 (0, 2) tests. Passed 44 tests."
#   eunit: "All 311 tests passed."  "2 tests passed."  "Test passed."
#          "Failed: 2.  Skipped: 0.  Passed: 309."
