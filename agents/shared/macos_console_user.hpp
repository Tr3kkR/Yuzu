// macos_console_user.hpp -- pure helpers for reaching the current macOS
// console (GUI) user's per-user session from a root/LaunchDaemon-context
// process, plus the certificates plugin's store->keychain mapping.
//
// Background: the agent's macOS process has no login keychain of its own --
// today it runs as root (no `UserName` key in com.yuzu.agent.plist; see
// docs/agent-privilege-model.md's TL;DR), and the target least-privilege
// `_yuzu` account (tracked as future hardening, #1455) would not have one
// either. `security` invoked directly therefore only ever sees the SYSTEM
// keychains, never the interactively-logged-in user's login keychain --
// that requires running the read INSIDE that user's per-user launchd/Aqua
// session: `[sudo -n -- ]launchctl asuser <uid> sudo -n -u <user> -- security ...`
// (see build_login_keychain_read_argv()'s own comment for exactly when
// the outer sudo applies).
//
// Every function here is pure (string parsing/validation/formatting only --
// no subprocess calls, no platform APIs), so the unit test
// (tests/unit/test_certificates_macos.cpp) exercises the exact logic the
// certificates plugin runs against fixture strings, without needing a real
// console session, `security`, or even to run on macOS at all -- same
// header-for-testability pattern as
// agents/plugins/installed_apps/src/installed_apps_inventory.hpp. The
// certificates_plugin.cpp .cpp file keeps the bounded-runner calls (stat/
// launchctl/sudo/security, all routed through
// yuzu::agent::run_bounded_subprocess -- see run_bounded_checked()) and the
// console-user RESOLUTION (whose device-owner half does need a subprocess;
// its uid/home half is a bounded passwd lookup since #3406, no longer the
// `id -u` spawn this line used to list); this header only ever sees strings
// it's handed.
//
// Deliberately framework-free: no SystemConfiguration
// (SCDynamicStoreCopyConsoleUser), so a CLT-only box still compiles this
// (matches the batch's no-new-framework convention).
//
// Injection guard: every value that ends up in the pre-split argv vector
// run_bounded_subprocess execs directly (no shell anywhere since #3406
// argv-ized this leg) -- console username, uid, home directory -- MUST pass
// is_valid_username / is_valid_uid / is_valid_home_dir here BEFORE use.
// With no shell there is no shell-metacharacter surface, but the allowlists
// are kept as ARGUMENT-injection defence (an option-shaped username like
// "-G" must never be read as a flag by sudo) and as defence in depth
// should a future caller regress the transport. build_login_keychain_
// read_argv() re-validates defensively and returns an empty vector on
// failure, so a missed guard upstream can never manufacture an executable
// command from unsafe input; the caller must treat an empty return as "do
// not run this."
//
// Owned solely by A-1.11 (mac-parity batch): the users (1.13) and
// interaction (1.22) plugins were already in flight when this header was
// authored and were deliberately NOT wired to it, so there is no
// cross-package collision today. A future package MAY reuse the
// console-user resolution helpers (parse_console_user_output /
// is_no_console_user / is_valid_username / is_valid_uid) for its own
// per-user-session needs; the store/keychain mapping below
// (KeychainStore / StorePlan / resolve_store_plan /
// resolve_delete_keychain_path) is certificates-plugin-specific and not
// intended for reuse as-is.

// (see the file banner) -- as a PRE-SPLIT argv vector for

// under ADR-3002). This replaces the former single-string `/bin/sh -c`
// form (rung 3, Decision-7 governed-shell exception), whose shell did
// exactly two jobs, both now performed without it: `~username` tilde
// expansion (the caller resolves the home via getpwnam_r and passes
// `home_dir`) and a `2>/dev/null` redirect (the runner's default,
// merge_stderr=false, already sends child stderr to /dev/null).
// Defensively re-validates every interpolated value even though callers
// are expected to have already validated them (uid/username via a
// successful resolve_console_user(), home_dir at resolution) -- returns an
// EMPTY vector on failure so a missed guard upstream can never produce an
// executable command; the caller must treat an empty return as "do not run
// this" (never fall back to running it anyway, never treat it as an
// empty-but-safe command).
//
// `--` END-OF-OPTIONS TERMINATOR on both sudo invocations, per ADR-3002
// Decision 8's canonical privileged-argv form. History worth keeping, because
// the reasoning was corrected twice (#3406 adversarial review): this site
// originally OMITTED `--` on the theory that inserting an argument the dormant
// #1455 sudoers grant does not name might silently stop that grant matching.
// That theory is WRONG, on two independently verified grounds:
//   * For the OUTER sudo, `--` is sudo's OWN option and is consumed during its
//     option parsing -- `man sudo`: "The -- is used to delimit the end of the
//     sudo options." What sudoers matches is the COMMAND after it, so the
//     grant string never sees the terminator at all.
//   * For the INNER sudo, `--` DOES sit inside the command string the outer
//     grant is matched against -- but sudoers wildcards are fnmatch-based and
//     `man sudoers` is explicit that `*` "Matches any set of zero or more
//     characters (including white space)", so `-u *` absorbs `<user> --`
//     regardless. (The grant text below is nonetheless written with the
//     terminators spelled out, so matching does not RELY on that subtlety.)
// Verified empirically on this host: `sudo -n -- <cmd>` and
// `sudo -n -u <user> -- <cmd>` both parse and reach the credential check
// exactly as the bare forms do.
//
// Note what `--` does and does not buy here, so a later reader does not
// over-credit it: the only values it protects are the COMMAND NAMES that
// follow it (`/bin/launchctl`, `/usr/bin/security`), and both are
// compile-time literals. Every caller-derived value on this line sits in an
// option-ARGUMENT slot (`asuser <uid>`, `-u <username>`, `-p <path>`) that a
// terminator cannot guard. Those are guarded instead by ADR-3002 Decision 6's
// named alternative, which this header satisfies independently: is_valid_uid
// (digits only), is_valid_username (rejects a leading '-'), and
// is_valid_home_dir (forces a leading '/'). So `--` is defence in depth and
// canonical-form conformance, NOT the control that closes option injection.
//
// `caller_is_root` mirrors the sudo_prefix() idiom already established in
// quarantine_plugin.cpp (geteuid() == 0 -> no sudo round-trip needed) --
// passed in rather than queried here via geteuid() so this function stays a
// PURE argv builder the unit test can exercise with a literal true/false
// fixture, matching every other function in this header (the .cpp does the
// actual geteuid() call -- see the certificates plugin's caller_is_root()).
// `launchctl asuser` itself requires root privileges (`man launchctl`), so
// a caller that ISN'T already root (the target `_yuzu` least-privilege
// account, future hardening #1455 -- NOT yet applied on macOS: per
// docs/agent-privilege-model.md's TL;DR the shipped LaunchDaemon still runs
// as root today, so caller_is_root() is true in production right now and
// this branch is dormant until #1455 lands) MUST escalate through its own
// outer `sudo -n` first -- without it, the sudoers grant this needs
// (`_yuzu ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /bin/launchctl asuser * /usr/bin/sudo -n -u *
// -- /usr/bin/security find-certificate -a -p *` -- handed to
// F-pf-provisioning as this package's provisioning note, to add when #1455
// narrows the macOS agent off root; not required for this package's
// acceptance criteria today) could never be exercised, because the command
// that's supposed to use it would never invoke sudo at all. The
// INNER `sudo -n -u <username>` is unconditional regardless of
// caller_is_root: `launchctl asuser` moves the launchd BOOTSTRAP CONTEXT
// into the target user's session but does not itself change the running
// UID, so dropping to that specific user is always a separate step. `-n`
// on both sudo calls is critical: non-interactive mode fails fast with a
// clear error if a grant is missing, rather than blocking the daemon on a
// password prompt it can never answer (mirrors quarantine_plugin.cpp's
// sudo_prefix() comment).
//
// Absolute paths throughout (/bin/launchctl, /usr/bin/sudo,
// /usr/bin/security -- not the bare `security` the pre-existing
// System/root reads elsewhere in the plugin use) -- this is new code, so
// it matches the PATH-injection-hardened convention
// docs/agent-privilege-model.md documents for sudoers entries ("required
// to prevent PATH-injection attacks") and mirrors that doc's own
// illustrative grant exactly, which simplifies writing the eventual
// sudoers rule if/when #1455 narrows the macOS agent off root (see the

// --- Appended for the certificates plugin's macOS delete path (#2274 DELETE half) ---
// `security delete-certificate` can exit 0 without the certificate actually
// being removed (ACL/SIP quirks, an unexpected keychain state), so the
// certificates plugin's macOS delete never trusts a zero exit status alone
// -- it re-enumerates the target keychain afterward and only reports
// "deleted" on a POSITIVELY-PROVEN absence (see delete_cert_macos() in
// certificates_plugin.cpp). This enum + classifier factor that decision out
// of the bounded-runner-calling .cpp into a pure function the unit test can
// exercise with fixture int/optional<bool> inputs, without forking
// `security` -- same header-for-testability split as every other symbol in
// this file.

// The four possible outcomes of a macOS certificate delete request whose
// thumbprint and target keychain already passed validation (invalid
// thumbprints, a SIP-sealed root store, and unsupported stores are all
// rejected earlier, before a delete is ever attempted -- this classifier
// only covers what happens once `security delete-certificate` has actually
// been run).
enum class DeleteVerdict {
    // The delete subprocess itself did not exit 0 (WEXITSTATUS != 0, or it
    // could not be spawned at all) -- an operational failure. Never
    // "deleted", never "absent": a failing command proves nothing about
    // the certificate's presence.
    kCommandFailed,
    // The delete subprocess exited 0, but the post-delete re-enumeration
    // used to verify the outcome could not read the target keychain at all
    // (locked, permission denied, missing, a `security` failure, ...). An
    // unreadable keychain MUST NOT be reported as "absent"/"deleted".
    kVerifyUnreadable,
    // The delete subprocess exited 0, AND the post-delete re-enumeration
    // successfully read the keychain but still found the thumbprint --
    // exactly the false-success this package exists to catch.
    kStillPresent,
    // The delete subprocess exited 0, AND the post-delete re-enumeration
    // positively proved the thumbprint is gone. The only verdict that may
    // report a completed delete.
    kDeleted,
};

// Pure decision: did the delete command exit 0 (`delete_exit_code`, from
// run_bounded_checked's CheckedCommandResult::exit_code -- itself copied
// from run_bounded_subprocess's SubprocessResult when the child actually
// ran; 0 for a clean successful exit, a positive POSIX exit code for a
// clean failure, or -1 if the child could not be spawned (exec failure) or
// did not exit normally (signaled -- e.g. killed at the deadline/cancel)),
// and -- ONLY when it did -- did the post-delete re-enumeration succeed in
// reading the keychain, and if so was the thumbprint still present
// (`still_present`)?
//
// Takes the raw exit code rather than a pre-collapsed bool so this pure
// decision is directly fixture-testable against representative rc values
// (zero, a representative nonzero exit, and the -1 exec-failure/signal-kill
// sentinel) without needing to fork a real subprocess to reach them. The
// WIFEXITED/WEXITSTATUS extraction itself deliberately stays in
// subprocess_runner.cpp (agents/core/src/subprocess_runner.cpp): those
// macros are POSIX-only (<sys/wait.h>), so they cannot live in this header,
// which is framework-free by design and compiles on every host including
// MSVC (see the file banner and test_certificates_macos.cpp's own doc
// comment).
//
// `still_present` is std::nullopt in exactly one situation: the delete
// succeeded (`delete_exit_code == 0`) but the verification re-enumeration
// itself could not read the target keychain. When `delete_exit_code != 0`
// the delete already failed outright, so no re-enumeration should have
// been attempted and `still_present` is ignored regardless of what it
// holds.
