/**
 * network_config_parsers.hpp — pure output/binary decoders for the
 * network_config plugin's native legs (PKG-NC, ADR-3002 acquisition-ladder
 * migration). No I/O, no spdlog — every parser here is unit-testable
 * directly against fixture text/bytes (see
 * tests/unit/test_network_config_parsers.cpp), mirroring the split already
 * established by agents/plugins/services/src/services_parsers.hpp and
 * agents/plugins/discovery/src/discovery_parsers.hpp: network_config_plugin.cpp
 * owns every subprocess/socket/sysctl call and hands this header the raw
 * text or bytes it captured.
 *
 * Three families:
 *   - /proc/net/arp text parsing (Linux arp leg). A standalone copy, not a
 *     re-include of discovery_parsers.hpp — the two decoders read the same
 *     kernel format but produce DIFFERENT field sets (this plugin's arp
 *     action needs the interface name and a static/dynamic type that
 *     discovery's does not), so neither is a superset of the other. If the
 *     two ever need to converge, the shared core belongs in agents/shared/
 *     as a zero-dependency header-only leaf — where this plugin already gets
 *     route_sysctl_arp.hpp from — with the two field-set wrappers on top.
 *   - resolvectl-cache / systemd-resolve-statistics captured-stdout line
 *     parsers (Linux dns_cache legs), moved here from the old inline
 *     istringstream loops in network_config_plugin.cpp.
 *   - PURE span-based binary decoders for the rtnetlink (Linux) and
 *     PF_ROUTE (macOS) reads. Bounds-checking discipline modeled EXACTLY on
 *     agents/shared/route_sysctl_arp.hpp: every length read from the blob
 *     is checked against the buffer before the corresponding bytes are
 *     dereferenced, a malformed/short record stops the walk rather than
 *     looping or reading out of bounds, and the caller learns about
 *     truncation instead of silently receiving a partial result.
 *
 *     ALIGNMENT CONTRACT (rtnetlink decoders only): the nlmsghdr/rtattr walk
 *     reads its header fields through the kernel's own NLMSG_ and RTA_
 *     macros, which cast into the caller's buffer rather than copying.
 *     Callers of the parse_rtnetlink chunk decoders must therefore pass a
 *     buffer aligned to at least NLMSG_ALIGNTO (production callers declare
 *     theirs
 *     `alignas(NLMSG_ALIGNTO)`, and so do the fixture tests). The variable-
 *     length PAYLOADS those headers describe — ifinfomsg, ifaddrmsg, rtmsg
 *     and every attribute value — are memcpy'd into locally-aligned objects
 *     before any field is read. parse_default_route_dump() takes no such
 *     precondition: it memcpys throughout.
 *
 *     The fixture tests satisfy the same precondition by a DIFFERENT
 *     mechanism: they build messages in a std::vector<unsigned char>, whose
 *     allocator returns storage aligned to at least alignof(max_align_t),
 *     which exceeds NLMSG_ALIGNTO. They do not declare alignas themselves —
 *     an earlier version of this comment said they did, which was false.

 * rather than looping or reading out of bounds.
 *
 * A route is the default route when its family is AF_INET, its RTAX_DST
