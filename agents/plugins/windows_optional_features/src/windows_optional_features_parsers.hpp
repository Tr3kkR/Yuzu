/**
 * windows_optional_features_parsers.hpp — pure state/row parsers and the
 * pure busy/timeout state machine for the windows_optional_features plugin.
 *
 * Deliberately free of <windows.h>: every function here is a plain string/
 * integer transform, testable on every OS via
 * tests/unit/test_windows_optional_features_parsers.cpp against P92-1's
 * real-capture fixtures — no DISM handle, no HRESULT, no wide string ever
 * crosses this header.
 *
 * `DismSlot` is the single owner of the busy/abandoned/timed-out state
 * machine windows_optional_features_plugin.cpp's Windows leg uses to keep
 * at most one DISM call in flight (DISM sessions are not documented as
 * safe for concurrent same-process use). It is pure — no thread, no clock,
 * no DISM call — so its acquired/busy/abandoned/release sequencing is
 * proven on every OS by the same test file that proves the row parsers.
