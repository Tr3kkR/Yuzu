## How it works

Four read-only actions (`local_security_policy_plugin.cpp`) report a host's local security policy: `password_policy`, `lockout_policy`, `audit_policy` and `sudoers`. Each writes pipe-delimited rows, the first field being the action name, then `<key>|<value>|<source>` (`sudoers` rows carry `<file>|<kind>|<subject>|<runas>|<nopasswd>|<commands>`). No action takes parameters, so no request text reaches a path or an argv. No host policy is ever configured or imported. Linux and macOS write nothing; the only file the Windows leg stages is `secedit`'s own export, in a scratch directory under `agent.data_dir` that it removes on return (`secedit` itself may also append to its default log; see "Scratch directory and stale sweep" below).

- **Linux (rung 1, bounded file reads):** `/etc/login.defs`, `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`, `/etc/security/faillock.conf`, the PAM files for each action — `password_policy` reads the `password`-type lines of `pam_pwquality`, `pam_pwhistory`, `pam_cracklib` and `pam_unix` in `/etc/pam.d/common-password`, `system-auth` and `password-auth`; `lockout_policy` reads the `auth`/`account`-type lines of `pam_faillock`, `pam_tally2` and `pam_tally` in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`, `common-account`, `system-auth` and `password-auth` (each row keyed `pam.<type>.<module>`, valued `<control> <args>`) — `/etc/audit/audit.rules` (rule, watch-rule, syscall-rule, unmodelled-line and control-line counts and the `-e` state -- `rules` is the RULE count, equal to `watch_rules + syscall_rules + unmodelled_lines`, while `control_lines` counts the directives that configure auditd rather than add a rule — exactly `-D`, `-b`, `-f`, `-r`, `-i`, `-c`, `-e`, `--backlog_wait_time` and `--loginuid-immutable` — so a stock file of nothing but control directives correctly reports `rules|0`; `enabled` is `enabled`/`disabled`/`immutable` for `-e 1`/`0`/`2`, `unset` with no `-e`, and `unmodelled:<raw>` for any other `-e` value), and `/etc/sudoers` plus `/etc/sudoers.d`.
- **macOS:** `password_policy` and `lockout_policy` come from `pwpolicy -getaccountpolicies`, a **rung-2** argv leaf (one spawn per action, sink `local_security_policy/do_password_policy#1`), because no public OpenDirectory global-policy API exists; the plist is parsed with `CFPropertyListCreateWithData`, never a hand-rolled scanner. A plist item not in the documented shape — a category whose value is not an array, a policy that is not a dictionary, `policyParameters` that is not a dictionary, a modelled field (`policyIdentifier`, `policyContent`, a parameter value) that is not a scalar, a non-string dictionary key, a key with no UTF-8 rendering, or an element carrying none of the reportable keys (`missing_content`) — is a `source_state|unreadable:<defect>` row with a `pwpolicy:<defect>` token (`CONSTRAINED`), never dropped and never `policies|none`. A string holding U+0000 has no faithful rendering and is the same defect, never a value cut at the NUL. A `policyAttribute*` parameter is its own key; any other scalar parameter (e.g. `autoEnableInSeconds`, the lockout duration) is `unmodelled_parameter` with the value `<name>=<value>`. Policy keys other than `policyIdentifier`, `policyContent` and `policyParameters` (e.g. the localised `policyContentDescription`) are ignored by design. `audit_policy` reads `/etc/security/audit_control` (absent by default on current macOS) and `sudoers` reads `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d`.
- **Windows (rung 2, not rung 1):** `password_policy`, `lockout_policy` and `audit_policy` share one `secedit.exe /export /areas SECURITYPOLICY` argv leaf (sink `local_security_policy/do_export#1`; `argv[0]` is the system directory from `GetSystemDirectoryW` plus `\secedit.exe`, never a `C:\Windows\System32` literal, and an unresolved system directory reports `secedit:system_directory_unresolved`), parsed from its UTF-16LE INI (`[System Access]` and `[Event Audit]`). An export counts only when it is whole: both of those sections present and the file ending in the `[Version]` section with `signature="$CHICAGO$"`, the shape measured on the-rig; anything else is `secedit:export_incomplete`, so a truncated file never reports its lost keys as `absent`. The roadmap first drafted this leg as `NetUserModalsGet`/`LsaQueryInformationPolicy` at rung 1; the tree has no LSA policy-query precedent, `NetUserModalsGet` was passed over, and `docs/agent-privilege-model.md` names `secedit /export` the authoritative source on a running box, so the leg is declared rung 2 and the descriptor, the capability matrix and this page all say so. `sudoers` has no Windows leg.

**Scratch directory and stale sweep (Windows).** `secedit` writes the export itself, to `<agent.data_dir>\local_security_policy-<32 hex>\policy.inf`: the **whole** `SECURITYPOLICY` area (privilege-right assignments with SIDs, registry values and more), not only the keys this plugin reports. Each dispatch creates that directory itself (random 128-bit name, created with `CREATE_NEW`, owner-only DACL), holds it open, checks it is the agent's own, and removes it and the file on every path the process survives. With `agent.data_dir` unset the action reports `constrained|data_dir_unset`: there is no fallback location. A crash or service stop between the export and the delete orphans that copy, so each Windows policy dispatch with `agent.data_dir` set and the system directory resolved first sweeps `local_security_policy-<32 hex>` directories older than one hour under `agent.data_dir`, ownership-verified (a same-named directory owned by another SID is skipped; a non-flat one is left intact). What a crash leaves behind: the orphaned directory stays until a later Windows dispatch finds it more than an hour old — indefinitely if none follows. The sweep outcome is never a row or a token; it is logged at warn, only when the pass did something, as `scratch_sweep: removed <n> failed <n> fresh <n> not_ours <n> deferred <n>`. Per Microsoft's `secedit` documentation, with no `/log` argument `secedit` also appends to its default log, `%windir%\security\logs\scesrv.log`; that was not measured on the rig.

Every source reads as exactly one of three things: a **value**, **`absent`** (the OS definitively reports the file, key or directory is not there) or **`unreadable`** (the read failed). A failed read never reads as absent, and absence is not a failure: an `absent` row adds no reason token and does not lower the status. Each failure adds one token, `<source>:<cause>` except for the Windows scratch-directory tokens (`data_dir_unset`, `dest_dir_*`), which keep the sibling `execution_artifacts` spelling. The status is `PERMISSION_DENIED` only when at least one read was refused, no source was readable and nothing else failed; a refusal alongside any readable source, and every other failure, is `CONSTRAINED` (so a Linux `sudoers` refusal next to a readable `/etc/sudoers.d` file is `CONSTRAINED`). A value the tables cannot interpret is named `unmodelled`, never dropped. Some shapes are silent by design, not failures: one absent PAM file while a sibling alternative exists (only all-absent is a `source_state|absent|/etc/pam.d` row); a file read successfully that sets none of the reported keys (Debian's all-commented `faillock.conf`, a PAM file with no matching module line); a PAM line that is not `type control module`, which PAM itself would reject; `login.defs` keys outside the per-action allow-list; `pwpolicy` element keys other than `policyIdentifier`/`policyContent`/`policyParameters` (such as the localised `policyContentDescription`); and a Windows `[Event Audit]` category the export omits. A `pwpolicy` element carrying none of those reportable keys is not silent: it is an `unreadable:missing_content` row.

**Why this plugin exists (stated plainly, not inflated).** Zero documented driver anywhere: not even a tangential mention across capability-map, enterprise-parity, the SOC 2 doc or `docs/roadmap.md` (the capability-map plugin-inventory row is added by this change as a listing, not a driver). The SOC 2 doc's Workstream B (Identity/Access/Admin Security) covers RBAC/SSO/MFA for **Yuzu's own** admin accounts, with zero overlap with a managed endpoint's local security policy. This is pure capability-gap reasoning, not evidenced demand.

**Declared limits per leg** (descriptor fallback text, verbatim):

- **`audit_policy` / Windows** — the LEGACY [Event Audit] categories only. Where Advanced Audit Policy subcategories are in force -- the Windows 10/11 default and the norm under GPO -- these are NOT the effective audit state: a category reading none means the legacy category is unset, not that the host is not auditing. auditpol subcategories are not read. It is the local security database (secedit /export without /mergedpolicy); domain-joined behaviour is unmeasured. The export (the whole SECURITYPOLICY area) is staged as agent.data_dir\\local_security_policy-{32 hex}\\policy.inf in an owner-only directory removed on return; each policy dispatch first sweeps such directories older than one hour, so a crash leaves one until a later dispatch. Measured only as LocalSystem, elevated, on a standalone host; see the Windows leg banner
- **`audit_policy` / macOS** — absent by default on current macOS (only audit_control.example ships), reported as absent; a present file is root-readable only
- **`audit_policy` / Linux** — rule counts and -e state of the rule file only, not the live kernel rules (auditctl -l) and not /etc/audit/rules.d; the file is 0640 root, so an unprivileged agent reports permission_denied; in a container (deploy/docker/Dockerfile.agent) these are the image's files, not the host's
- **`lockout_policy` / Windows** — argv leaf parsed from the exported UTF-16LE INI: the local security database (secedit /export without /mergedpolicy); domain-joined behaviour is unmeasured. The export (the whole SECURITYPOLICY area) is staged as agent.data_dir\\local_security_policy-{32 hex}\\policy.inf in an owner-only directory removed on return; each policy dispatch first sweeps such directories older than one hour, so a crash leaves one until a later dispatch. Measured only as LocalSystem, elevated, on a standalone host; see the Windows leg banner
- **`lockout_policy` / macOS** — global account policies only; no authentication policy reports policies|none (the default); a plist item not in the documented shape is an unreadable row and constrained. Measured on an UNMANAGED Mac, so on a managed device policies|none must not be read as 'no lockout enforced' -- profile-delivered policy is unverified here
- **`lockout_policy` / Linux** — reports configuration, not live lockout counters; faillock.conf drop-ins and PAM include/substack targets are not read; in a container (deploy/docker/Dockerfile.agent) these are the image's files, not the host's
- **`password_policy` / Windows** — argv leaf parsed from the exported UTF-16LE INI: the local security database (secedit /export without /mergedpolicy); domain-joined behaviour is unmeasured. The export (the whole SECURITYPOLICY area) is staged as agent.data_dir\\local_security_policy-{32 hex}\\policy.inf in an owner-only directory removed on return; each policy dispatch first sweeps such directories older than one hour, so a crash leaves one until a later dispatch. Measured only as LocalSystem, elevated, on a standalone host; see the Windows leg banner
- **`password_policy` / macOS** — global account policies only; rung 2 because no public OpenDirectory global-policy API exists; policy expressions are verbatim; a policyAttribute* parameter is its own key and any other is unmodelled_parameter <name>=<value>; a plist item not in the documented shape is an unreadable row and constrained. Measured on an UNMANAGED Mac: whether an MDM configuration-profile passcode payload surfaces here is unverified
- **`password_policy` / Linux** — reports what the config files state, not the live PAM decision; pwquality.conf.d fragments and PAM include/substack targets are not read; a missing file is reported as absent, an unreadable one as unreadable (permission_denied/constrained); in a container (deploy/docker/Dockerfile.agent) these are the image's files, not the host's
- **`sudoers` / macOS** — /etc/sudoers is root:wheel 0440: reading it needs root or group wheel, otherwise permission_denied (kind unreadable)
- **`sudoers` / Linux** — parsed content, not sudo's evaluation: include directives are listed, not followed; unrecognised lines are kind unmodelled; needs read access to the 0440 root files; in a container (deploy/docker/Dockerfile.agent) these are the image's files, not the host's

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | `secedit /export` needs an elevated token. What was measured, and only that: on the-rig, run as LocalSystem from a scheduled task (RunLevel Highest), the export succeeded with `SeSecurityPrivilege` present but in its default **Disabled** state (the `RIG PROBE` banner in `local_security_policy_win.cpp`, `docs/samples/windows.txt`). Which privilege is actually required, and whether the dedicated `NT SERVICE\YuzuAgent` account (which holds `SeSecurityPrivilege` via `scripts/install-agent-user.ps1`) succeeds, were **not** measured | Yes, as LocalSystem on a standalone Windows 11 Pro host (rig probe 2026-09-21; committed sample re-captured 2026-09-23): a real 12,828-byte `secedit` export (UTF-16LE) and the committed sample. No fixture of the export is committed | A refused `secedit` run is expected to exit non-zero and report `CONSTRAINED` with `secedit:exit_<n>` (not measured). `PERMISSION_DENIED` with `secedit:access_denied` is reported only when the agent cannot open its own export file (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`; never observed). Either way the action returns 1 with the row `constrained\|<token>` |
| macOS | agent daemon, root today (LaunchDaemon carries no `UserName` key, `docs/agent-privilege-model.md` TL;DR) | None for `pwpolicy -getaccountpolicies`; `/etc/sudoers` is `root:wheel` `0440`, so reading it needs root or group wheel | Bare-metal, this Mac (`braga`), unprivileged (euid 501; probe 2026-09-21, committed sample re-captured 2026-09-23): real capture (`docs/samples/macos.txt`); no root-privileged run has been captured | `EACCES` on `/etc/sudoers` reports the row kind `unreadable` with `permission_denied` and the action reports `PERMISSION_DENIED`/`PARTIAL`; a failed `pwpolicy` run reports `CONSTRAINED` with `pwpolicy:<cause>` |
| Linux | agent daemon, default | None for the world-readable config; `/etc/audit/audit.rules` (`0640`) and `/etc/sudoers` plus `/etc/sudoers.d/*` (`0440`) need root or a read-override capability | Only in a container: the live sample under `docs/samples/linux.txt` is a run of the built `.so` as root inside a Debian 13 container hardened for the capture (sudo with a `sudoers.d` drop-in, auditd rules, pwquality and faillock values), so it describes that container's `/etc`, not a host (caveat 4). No fixtures are committed and no bare-metal Linux host has been captured | `EACCES`/`EPERM` reports the source `unreadable` with `<path>:permission_denied`; the action reports `PERMISSION_DENIED` when nothing else was readable, otherwise `CONSTRAINED`; a missing file (`ENOENT`) reports `absent` with no token |

Binaries/subprocesses: Windows runs `<system directory>\secedit.exe /export /cfg <agent.data_dir>\local_security_policy-<32 hex>\policy.inf /areas SECURITYPOLICY /quiet` (system directory from `GetSystemDirectoryW`, absolute path, no shell, no PowerShell, no `/configure`; the only file the agent stages is that export, and `secedit` may append to its default `scesrv.log`); macOS runs `/usr/bin/pwpolicy -getaccountpolicies` (absolute path, no shell); Linux runs nothing. Network: none.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
No action takes parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited rows via `write_output()`. The first field is the fixed literal action name (`password_policy`, `lockout_policy`, `audit_policy` or `sudoers`), then `<key>`, `<value>` and `<source>` (for `sudoers`: `<file>`, `<kind>`, `<subject>`, `<runas>`, `<nopasswd>`, `<commands>`). Every field passes through the shared untrusted-output escaper. A key present with no value reads `present`. A source that is missing or unreadable is one `source_state` row (`absent`, or `unreadable:<token>`); a `sudoers` source is instead a row of kind `absent` (`commands` is `-`) or `unreadable` (`commands` is the bare token, e.g. `permission_denied`). A macOS `pwpolicy` item not in the documented plist shape is a `source_state|unreadable:<defect>` row whose source names the policy identifier or category (`pwpolicy` when neither is known). Windows `password_policy`/`lockout_policy` always emit their fixed key list, and a key the export does not carry reads `absent`; Windows `audit_policy` instead emits one row per `[Event Audit]` category the export actually carries — a category the export omits has no row (no `absent` row), and a missing or empty `[Event Audit]` section is `CONSTRAINED` (`secedit:section_missing_event_audit`). macOS reports `policies|none` when no matching policy is set and no item was malformed, which is the default. In `sudoers`, each `:`-separated `Host_List = ...` clause of a user spec is its own row, and Option_Spec words (`CWD=`, `CHROOT=`, `TIMEOUT=`, `NOTBEFORE=`, `ROLE=`, `APPARMOR_PROFILE=`, ...) stay verbatim in `commands` like every tag other than `NOPASSWD`/`PASSWD`. Files are lexed as sudo 1.9.16's `toke.l` lexes them: a `:` inside a quoted value (`CWD="/x y:z"`), an escape, an IPv6 host or a digest never splits a clause, and a `#` comment, glued to a word or not, never continues onto the next line. That was checked differentially against sudo's own `sudo -ll` verdicts on a generated corpus of `visudo`-accepted files, with no mismatch. As a fail-safe, a line still carrying a `NOPASSWD:`/`PASSWD:` tag the parser could not decode is kind `unmodelled` plus the token `<file>:undecoded_passwd_tag` (`CONSTRAINED`). What this does not cover: `nopasswd` is the tag alone (see "Sensitivity"); aliases and includes are not resolved; another sudo version may lex differently; a line sudo itself rejects is reported best-effort. A file holding a NUL byte is `unreadable:embedded_nul` as a whole (`<path>:embedded_nul`): C consumers stop at the NUL, so no value after it can be reported as the one in force. A Windows export holding one anywhere is `secedit:embedded_nul` with no rows.

**Row cap.** The file-backed actions (every Linux action, and macOS `audit_policy`/`sudoers`) stop at 4096 rows per dispatch: 4095 data rows plus one marker row, and the status becomes `CONSTRAINED` with the token `row_cap`. The marker is `<action>|source_state|unreadable:row_cap|<action>` (its source field is the action name, not a path) for the four-field actions and `sudoers|-|unreadable|-|-|-|row_cap` for `sudoers`. The `pwpolicy` and Windows `secedit` paths are not row-capped; they are bounded by the tool's output cap (`pwpolicy:output_truncated`) and the 1 MiB export cap (`secedit:output_oversized`). The `/etc/sudoers.d` listing is separately capped at 256 entries (`sudoers.d:truncated`, row `sudoers|/etc/sudoers.d|unreadable|-|-|-|truncated`).

**Failure rows and return codes.** When a non-OK outcome produced no rows at all — today only a failed `pwpolicy` run (spawn error, deadline, truncated output, non-zero exit, no plist or an unparseable one) — the action writes one `<action>|status|constrained|<reason>` row rather than an empty result; the fourth field carries the reason token, not a source. (`status|permission_denied` exists only as a defensive branch: no current source reaches it.) File-backed and `pwpolicy` failures are data-level outcomes and the action returns 0. Only two cases write the two-field row `constrained|<token>` and return 1: every Windows-leg failure, and an exception contained on any OS (`constrained|internal_error`). On Windows that row reads `constrained` even when the typed status is `PERMISSION_DENIED` (the status field and the token, e.g. `secedit:access_denied`, carry the distinction). `sudoers` on Windows returns 1 with the row `sudoers|-|unsupported|-|-|-|windows_has_no_sudoers` and status `UNAVAILABLE`.

For status, constrained -- the only state any leg reaches today. |
| `source` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `/etc/login.defs` | Where the row was read: a file path, or /etc/pam.d when every PAM file of the action is absent (Linux); pwpolicy:<policy identifier>, pwpolicy:<category> when the policy has no identifier, or pwpolicy (macOS); secedit (Windows). The row-cap marker carries the action name. On a status row this field carries the failure reason token instead, not a source. |

**`crossplatform.local_security_policy.sudoers` — `row_kind|file|kind|subject|runas|nopasswd|commands`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `row_kind` | string | `sudoers` `constrained` | Linux, macOS | `sudoers` | Fixed row tag, always sudoers. Read failures stay in this seven-field shape (kind absent or unreadable); only an exception contained in the plugin writes a two-field constrained\|internal_error row instead. |
| `file` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `/etc/sudoers` | The file the entry was read from; /etc/sudoers.d on a row about the directory listing itself; a dash on the row-cap marker. |
| `kind` | string | `defaults` `alias` `include` `includedir` `user_spec` `unmodelled` `ignored` `absent` `unreadable` | Linux, macOS | `user_spec` | Entry kind. defaults, alias, include, includedir, user_spec: a recognised line. unmodelled: a line the parser has no interpretation for (raw line in commands); one that still carries a NOPASSWD: or PASSWD: tag the parser could not decode also adds the failure token <file>:undecoded_passwd_tag (CONSTRAINED). Lines are lexed as sudo 1.9.16 lexes them (checked against sudo -ll), so a colon in a quoted value, an IPv6 host or a digest never splits a clause; the nopasswd column is the tag alone, and a line sudo itself rejects is best-effort. ignored: a sudoers.d file sudo skips by name (commands name_ignored_by_sudo). absent: the file or the /etc/sudoers.d directory does not exist. unreadable: the read failed (bare reason token in commands, e.g. permission_denied; truncated on the /etc/sudoers.d row when the listing hit its 256-entry cap; row_cap, with file -, on the marker row once output reaches 4096 rows). The plugin also emits kind unsupported on Windows (reason windows_has_no_sudoers in commands), which this definition cannot surface because it does not run there. |
| `subject` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `%sudo@ALL` | Who the entry applies to. A user spec carries <user>@<host> -- the user, group or alias joined to the host list the spec applies on; each colon-separated Host_List clause of one line is its own row. An alias row carries <Alias_Type>:<name>. A scoped Defaults line carries its scope (user:, host:, cmnd:, runas:). A dash when not applicable. |
| `runas` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `ALL` | Run-as user/group of a user spec; a dash when not applicable. |
| `nopasswd` | string | `true` `false` `-` | Linux, macOS | `false` | Whether a user spec carries the NOPASSWD tag: true or false; a dash on a row that is not a user spec. It reflects the tag only: a Defaults row with !authenticate (kind defaults) also makes matching grants passwordless and must be read alongside it. |
| `commands` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `ALL` | The command list of a user spec (any tag other than NOPASSWD/PASSWD, e.g. SETENV:, is kept in front of its command as TAG: , and any Option_Spec such as CWD=/tmp or TIMEOUT=5m verbatim), the Defaults or alias body, an include path, the raw text of an unmodelled line, the reason on an ignored or unreadable row, or a dash on an absent row. |

### Result status

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` | `FULL` | - | Every source was read or definitively `absent`. An absent source adds no token, so a default macOS host with no `audit_control` reports `OK`. |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `<path>:symlink_loop`, `<path>:io_error`, `<path>:oversized`, `<path>:not_regular`, `<path>:errno_<n>`, `<path>:embedded_nul`, `<path>:permission_denied`, `<path>:undecoded_passwd_tag`, `sudoers.d:<cause>`, `sudoers.d:truncated`, `row_cap` | Linux and macOS file reads: at least one source failed for a reason other than a refusal, or a refusal while something else was readable; the reason lists one token per failure. `<path>` is the full path, including `/etc/sudoers.d/<name>` for a file in that directory; a failure to list the directory itself is `sudoers.d:<cause>` (the bare name `sudoers.d`, not the path). |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `pwpolicy:spawn_error`, `pwpolicy:deadline`, `pwpolicy:cancelled`, `pwpolicy:signaled`, `pwpolicy:unexpected_termination`, `pwpolicy:output_truncated`, `pwpolicy:exit_<n>`, `pwpolicy:no_plist`, `pwpolicy:plist_unparseable` | macOS `password_policy` and `lockout_policy`: the `pwpolicy` run or its plist failed. |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `pwpolicy:malformed_category`, `pwpolicy:malformed_policy`, `pwpolicy:malformed_parameters`, `pwpolicy:malformed_identifier`, `pwpolicy:malformed_content`, `pwpolicy:malformed_parameter_value`, `pwpolicy:non_string_key`, `pwpolicy:unconvertible_key`, `pwpolicy:missing_content` | macOS `password_policy` and `lockout_policy`: the plist parsed but an item was not in the documented shape; each is also a `source_state\|unreadable:<defect>` row, alongside every well-formed policy's rows. |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `data_dir_unset`, `secedit:system_directory_unresolved`, `dest_dir_create_<n>`, `dest_dir_open_<n>`, `dest_dir_acl`, `secedit:spawn_error`, `secedit:deadline`, `secedit:cancelled`, `secedit:signaled`, `secedit:unexpected_termination`, `secedit:exit_<n>`, `secedit:output_missing`, `secedit:read_<n>`, `secedit:output_not_regular`, `secedit:output_oversized`, `secedit:output_short_read`, `secedit:decode_failed`, `secedit:export_incomplete`, `secedit:embedded_nul`, `secedit:section_missing_system_access`, `secedit:section_missing_event_audit`, `secedit:unsupported_action` | Windows: the scratch directory or the `secedit` run or export failed; the action returns 1 with the row `constrained\|<token>`. |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `internal_error` | Any leg: an unexpected exception was contained in `execute()`; the action returns 1 with the row `constrained\|internal_error`. |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | `PARTIAL` | `<path>:permission_denied`, `sudoers.d:permission_denied`, `secedit:access_denied` | File legs: at least one read was refused, no source was readable and nothing else failed. Windows: the agent could not open its own export file (`ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`; never observed — a refused `secedit` run surfaces as `secedit:exit_<n>` instead). |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | `PARTIAL` | `windows_has_no_sudoers`, `unsupported_os` | `sudoers` dispatched on Windows; or any action on an OS with no leg (not a supported platform; row `constrained\|unsupported_os`). |

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response and land in the ResponseStore, queryable at `/api/responses/{id}`. Each action is a gathered definition (`crossplatform.local_security_policy.<action>`, 300s TTL).
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync, TAR, DEX, or metrics.
- **Sensitivity.** Password, lockout and audit rows are a compliance baseline of the host (a short minimum length, no lockout, auditing off), which is useful to an attacker choosing a target. `sudoers` rows carry account and group names, run-as targets, `NOPASSWD` flags and command paths, i.e. who may become root. The `nopasswd` column reflects the `NOPASSWD` tag only: a `Defaults[:user] !authenticate` row also makes matching grants passwordless and must be read alongside it. Treat all four like other `Security` data.
- **Siblings:** `firewall`, `bitlocker` and `antivirus` (other `Security` posture plugins) and `users` (account and group membership; this plugin reports policy, not accounts).

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **No documented business driver.** The priority for this plugin is asserted from a capability-gap reading, not evidenced by any tracked demand (see "How it works"); there is no capability-map requirement, named customer, SOC 2 control or CVE behind it.
2. **Configuration, not evaluation; Windows `audit_policy` is the legacy categories only.** Files are reported as written, not as PAM, sudo or auditd would evaluate them (drop-ins, includes and `/etc/audit/rules.d` are not followed), and a Windows `none` means the legacy `[Event Audit]` category is unset, not that the host is not auditing — Advanced Audit Policy (`auditpol`) is not read. Some shapes produce no row at all (listed under "How it works"), so for them "not set" and "not read" look the same.
3. **Windows is measured once, as LocalSystem on a standalone host with the default `agent.data_dir`, and stages a full policy export on disk.** Which privilege is required, whether `NT SERVICE\YuzuAgent` succeeds, domain-joined behaviour (the export is the local security database, without `/mergedpolicy`) and a non-default `agent.data_dir` (an SMB share, a non-NTFS volume, a path over `MAX_PATH`, which may fail the leg as `dest_dir_acl` or `secedit:exit_<n>`) are unmeasured; the staged copy holds the whole `SECURITYPOLICY` area and outlives a crash until a later Windows dispatch sweeps it, indefinitely if none follows, and an uninstall that keeps the data directory keeps it too.
4. **Privileged files read `unreadable` for an unprivileged agent, and a container reports its own `/etc`.** `sudoers`, `sudoers.d` and `audit.rules` need root or a read-override capability, and are then an `unreadable` row, never an empty list. The shipped `Dockerfile.agent` image runs unprivileged with no host `/etc`, so it reports the image's files (the committed Linux sample is a root run in a hardened Debian 13 container, which likewise describes that container, not a host).
5. **Global scope only, unmanaged captures, and no cross-OS normalisation.** macOS reports global (not per-user) policy from an unmanaged Mac, so on an MDM-managed device `policies|none` must not be read as "no lockout enforced". Keys stay in each OS's own vocabulary (`MinimumPasswordLength`, `PASS_MIN_LEN`/`minlen`, `minimum_length`), so fleet baselines branch per OS.
