/**
 * local_security_policy_plugin.cpp -- password / lockout / audit policy posture and
 * sudoers content (read-only). Portable TU; the only target-OS #ifs are the Windows
 * sudoers short-circuit and the dispatch to a leg (local_security_policy_{linux,macos,
 * win}.cpp behind local_security_policy_legs.hpp).
 * Row shapes and failure semantics: local_security_policy_parsers.hpp. File reads are
 * unprivileged except /etc/sudoers + the /etc/sudoers.d files (0440), Linux /etc/audit/audit.rules
 * (0640) and a present macOS /etc/security/audit_control (root-only): a refused read is an
 * `unreadable` row with a `<source>:permission_denied` token -- PERMISSION_DENIED when
 * nothing else was readable, CONSTRAINED otherwise -- never an empty result. Windows
 * secedit needs an elevated token (measured only as LocalSystem; see the leg banner).
 * CONTAINERS: the Linux leg reads the /etc it can see, which in the shipped
 * deploy/docker/Dockerfile.agent image (unprivileged `yuzu-agent`, no host /etc mounted)
 * is the IMAGE's -- its rows describe the container, not the host.
