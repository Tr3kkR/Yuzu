## How it works

Both actions are reads; the plugin has no rule-mutation surface despite its name. `state` reports whether the host firewall is on, per profile or per backend. `rules` lists the rule set the same backend exposes. On Windows both go through the `INetFwPolicy2` COM interface: `state` asks each of the Domain, Private and Public profiles for `FirewallEnabled`; `rules` enumerates `INetFwRules` and stops after 100 rules with a `truncated|true` marker row. On macOS `state` reads the Application Firewall global state through `socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` (the firewall a Mac administrator means), adds a `mode|block_all` row when block-all is set, then reads the pf packet-filter status through `pfctl -s info` as a secondary row, then `pfctl -s Anchors` and `pfctl -s rules` for the pf anchor list and rule count; `rules` reads the per-app allow/block list through `socketfilterfw --listapps`, lists pf rules through `pfctl -s rules`, then the same pf anchors and rule count. Each pf-backed read (anchors, rule count) is emitted only when it completed cleanly — a refused or partial read yields no anchor rows and `ruleset|unknown` rather than a partial answer presented as the whole. On Linux the plugin probes backends in a fixed order and stops at the first that answers: firewalld over sd-bus, then nftables over `NETLINK_NETFILTER` dumps, then `ufw status numbered`, then `iptables -S`, else `backend|none`. Each macOS subprocess call is bounded independently, so worst case is roughly additive across the sequential reads: ~15 s for `rules` (3 calls) and ~20 s for `state` (4 calls) if every one refuses or times out.

Every subprocess runs through the bounded runner with a fixed deadline; every parse is a pure function in `firewall_parsers.hpp`. On Linux, firewalld, nftables, ufw and iptables are each bounded to their own ~5s acquisition deadline and probed in that fixed order, so a run that must walk every leg takes up to ~20s worst case (4 legs × 5s). The nftables leg further verifies each dump reply's sender (`nl_pid == 0`, genuinely from the kernel rather than a foreign process sharing the netlink family) before trusting it, and splits that ~5s deadline across three sequential per-dump budget slices (table, then chain, then rule) rather than one shared timeout for all three. The honest-status invariant holds on every leg: empty, truncated or unrecognised output parses to `unknown` (state) or no rows (rules), never to a false-safe "disabled" or a fabricated rule. Once nftables' table dump succeeds but a later chain or rule dump fails, the leg writes a `fallthrough|nftables:<dump>:<reason>` provenance row and falls through to `ufw` then `iptables` (clamped so a downstream "disabled" can't contradict tables already seen) rather than stopping there; only when neither backend answers either does the run report `backend|nftables` + `state|unknown` (or `rules|unknown`) plus an `error|nftables:<dump>:<reason>` row naming why.

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | None. `INetFwPolicy2` profile and rule reads need no elevation. | 2026-09-06 on the-rig (Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200), elevated SSH session: three profiles read `enabled`, 100 rule rows plus the `truncated\|true` marker | `error\|com_init` or `error\|policy2_create:<hresult>` row; profile rows read `error:<hresult>` |
| macOS | LaunchDaemon (root today) | None for the Application Firewall reads (`socketfilterfw --getglobalstate` and `--listapps` are both unprivileged). The pf reads (`pfctl -s info`/`Anchors`/`rules`) open `/dev/pf` and need root; the plugin deliberately does not ride the quarantine plugin's `pfctl` sudoers grant. | 2026-09-14 at euid 501 on this host: `socketfilterfw --listapps` succeeds and emits `app\|` rows; `pfctl -s Anchors` and `pfctl -s rules` are both refused with `Permission denied`, so anchors are empty and `ruleset\|unknown` | `pf\|unknown` / `ruleset\|unknown` (state, rules), no anchor or pf rule rows, never a false-safe value; `app\|` rows are unaffected since `--listapps` needs no privilege |
| Linux | agent service account | `firewall-cmd --state` is an unprivileged D-Bus query. The nftables netlink dump conventionally needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN` (verified 2026-08-23 with the capability present); `ufw status` and `iptables -S` need root. No sudoers entry is granted for any of them. | nftables verified 2026-08-23 in an Ubuntu 26.04 container with `CAP_NET_ADMIN`. The no-cap (unprivileged) signature is reasoned from the dispatch code itself — sender-verified (`nl_pid == 0`) reads, `classify_open_errno`/`nft_dump_reason` EPERM/EMFILE decoding, and the fixed C4 fall-through ladder — not measured on a live no-cap host, and it is **qualified by which rung-2 backend binaries are installed**: on a host where `ufw` or `iptables` exists, a refused nftables read falls through and the ladder terminates at `backend\|iptables` (or `backend\|ufw`) + `state\|unknown`, never `backend\|none`; `backend\|none` appears only when neither rung-2 binary is present at all | a refused nftables table dump (EPERM or other kernel error, or `EMFILE`/`ENFILE` reporting `error\|fd_exhausted`) falls through to `ufw` then `iptables`, each clamped so neither reports a false "disabled" contradicting tables already seen; a refused chain or rule dump after a successful table dump behaves the same way, first writing `fallthrough\|nftables:<dump>:<reason>`; if neither `ufw` nor `iptables` answers either, the run reports `backend\|nftables` + `state\|unknown` / `rules\|unknown` plus `error\|nftables:<dump>:<reason>`; a refused `iptables -S` alone (the last backend, nothing further to fall through to) reports `backend\|iptables` + `state\|unknown` / `rules\|unknown`; `backend\|none` appears only when no backend ran at all — neither `/usr/sbin/ufw` nor `/usr/sbin/iptables` exists, or `ufw` was refused and `iptables` is absent |

Subprocesses: `socketfilterfw`, `pfctl` (macOS), `ufw`, `iptables` (Linux), each as an argv vector through the bounded runner (rung 2), never a shell. Windows and the firewalld and nftables legs are native (rung 1). No network access.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
Neither action takes parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited key rows; the first field is the row kind. `state` emits `profile|<Domain|Private|Public>|<enabled|disabled|unknown|error:0x…>` plus `ruleset|<count>` on Windows, and `backend|<name>`, `state|<value>`, optional `mode|block_all`, `pf|<value>`, optional `anchor|<name>` and `ruleset|<count|unknown>` rows on macOS and Linux. `rules` emits `rule|<name>|<enabled|disabled>|<in|out|unknown>|<allow|block|unknown>|<profile mask>` on Windows (plus `truncated|true` after 100 rows and a trailing `ruleset|<count>` counting the rules actually emitted this call, capped at 100 — distinct from `state`'s `ruleset|<count>`, which is the true policy total from `INetFwRules::get_Count`), on macOS `app|<path>|<allow|block|unknown>` rows from `socketfilterfw --listapps`, `rule|<raw pf line>` rows, optional `anchor|<name>` rows and a trailing `ruleset|<count|unknown>`, and per backend on Linux: `rule|firewalld|<zone>|service|<service>`, `rule|nftables|<family>|<table>|<chain>|<hook>|<policy>` and `rule|nftables|<family>|<table>|<chain>|handle|<n>`, `rule|<index>|<to>|<action>|<from>` for ufw, and `rule|<policy|new_chain|append>|<chain>|<spec>` for iptables — so on Linux the field after `rule` is the backend name for firewalld and nftables, a numeric index for ufw and the entry kind for iptables. On macOS the `app|` row's third field is the per-app decision, `allow`, `block` or `unknown`, never dropped or coerced; `ruleset|unknown` on macOS means the backing `pfctl -s rules` read was refused or incomplete (typically a permissions denial), not that the ruleset is empty — a cleanly-read empty ruleset reports `ruleset|0`. A backend that answers `backend|<name>` but whose rule dump is refused emits `rules|unknown`. On Linux, a refused or fd-exhausted nftables read additionally emits an `error|nftables:<dump>:<reason>` or `error|fd_exhausted` row naming the failure, a handed-off-to-the-next-backend dump emits `fallthrough|nftables:<dump>:<reason>`, and the rule count follows the same `ruleset|<n>` / `ruleset|unknown` convention as macOS — never a fabricated `ruleset|0`. The server parses this plugin as key/value rows (`profile_or_backend`, `state`), so the value column carries the remainder of each row verbatim. Windows rules sharing a display name (one per profile, protocol or direction, e.g. six `ChatGPT` rows) are each real rules, not a capture defect. A run that reads nothing emits no `rule` rows and, for state, `unknown` values; it never fabricates a row.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen outputs -->
**`security.firewall.rules` — `rule_name|enabled|direction|action|profiles`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rule_name` | string | `rule` `app` `anchor` `ruleset` `truncated` | all | `Core Networking - DNS (UDP-Out)` | The row key, and the field after it for "rule" rows. Windows: "rule" rows with the rule's display name, plus a trailing "ruleset" row (the count of rules actually emitted this call, capped at 100) and "truncated" (present only past that cap). Linux: "rule" rows only — backend literal "firewalld" (then zone, "service", service name) or "nftables" (then family, table, chain, hook and policy — or "handle" and the handle number); the numbered index for ufw; the entry kind for iptables (policy, new_chain, append; then chain and rule spec). macOS: "rule" rows carry the raw pf rule line; "app" rows carry the per-app path and allow/block/unknown decision (unprivileged, from socketfilterfw --listapps); "anchor" rows carry one pf anchor name each; "ruleset" is the pf rule count, or unknown when the pf read was refused or incomplete — anchor and ruleset are both root-only. The server clamps the row to two fields, so the remainder lands in the value column. |
| `enabled` | string | `enabled` `disabled` | Windows | `enabled` | Windows only; enabled or disabled. |
| `direction` | string | `in` `out` `unknown` | Windows | `out` | Windows only; in, out or unknown. |
| `action` | string | `allow` `block` `unknown` | Windows | `allow` | Windows only; allow, block or unknown. |
| `profiles` | string | - | Windows | `2147483647` | Windows only; the NET_FW_PROFILE_TYPE2 bitmask as an integer (1 domain, 2 private, 4 public, 2147483647 all). |

**`security.firewall.state` — `profile_or_backend|state`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `profile_or_backend` | string | `profile` `backend` `state` `mode` `pf` `anchor` `error` `fallthrough` `ruleset` | all | `profile` | Row key. Windows: "profile" rows carry the profile name in the next field (Domain, Private, Public). Linux and macOS: "backend", "state", "mode" and "pf" rows, one key each. Linux additionally emits "error" rows (a refused or fd-exhausted backend read), "fallthrough" rows (the nftables leg handing off to the next backend after a dump failure), and "ruleset" rows (the rule count, or unknown when that count could not be trusted). macOS additionally emits "anchor" rows (one pf anchor name each, root-only) and its own "ruleset" row (the pf rule count, or unknown when the read was refused or incomplete). |
| `state` | string | - | all | `enabled` | The remainder of the row after the key (the server clamps this plugin to two fields). Windows "profile" rows: the profile name (Domain, Private, Public), then its state (enabled, disabled, unknown or error:<hresult>). Linux "state" rows: running (firewalld), active, inactive or unknown. macOS "state" rows: enabled, disabled or unknown; "pf" rows the same; "mode" row is block_all; "anchor" rows carry one pf anchor name each (root-only, omitted when the read is refused or incomplete). "backend" rows name the backend (appfirewall, firewalld, nftables, ufw, iptables, none). "ruleset" rows carry the rule count as an integer, or unknown whenever the backend's read was incomplete or refused rather than a fabricated 0 — on Linux this is the nftables/ufw/iptables rule count; on macOS it is the pf rule count (root-only). Linux "error" rows: nftables:<table\|chain\|rule>:<eperm\|timeout\|foreign_flood\|...> for a refused/failed dump, or fd_exhausted for EMFILE/ENFILE on the nftables socket. Linux "fallthrough" rows: nftables:<table\|chain\|rule>:<reason>, written when a dump fails and the leg hands off to the next backend. |

### Result status

The plugin does not call `set_result_status`; every run reports `UNDECLARED`, from which the agent derives `OK` when `execute` returns 0. Degradation is carried in the rows themselves (`unknown`, `error|…`, `backend|none`, `truncated|true`), not in the typed status.

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` (derived from `UNDECLARED`) | — | — | every run that returns 0, including degraded reads |

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result only.** Rows land in the ResponseStore (90-day default retention), queryable at `/api/responses/{id}`; `security.firewall.state` aggregates by `state` and drives the fleet pie "Firewall profile state across the fleet" (profile rows, labelled by value).
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync inventory, the TAR warehouse, DEX, or metrics. Both definitions carry a gather TTL (120 s and 300 s) but no schedule; they run when dispatched.
- **Sensitivity.** `rules` rows name installed applications on the host (Windows rule display names are application names — an installed-software inventory by another route; macOS `rules` rows carry the same kind of disclosure via unprivileged per-app allow/block entries, `app|<path>|...`, naming installed executables by absolute path) and, on Linux, the host's network policy; on macOS, both `state` and `rules` rows may also carry pf anchor names, which can identify installed network/security software (VPN clients, security tools) or local pf policy structure — `state` is otherwise limited to the device id.
- **MCP / REST.** Discover: `discover_plugins` (summary) → `yuzu://plugin-docs` (this page as data) → `discover_instructions` / `get_definition("security.firewall.state")`. Run: `execute_instruction {definition_id, parameters}`. Read: `/api/responses/{id}`.
- **Siblings:** `quarantine` (mutates firewall state through its own sudoers-granted `pfctl` anchor and Windows firewall rules), `rdp_control` (toggles the Remote Desktop rule group through `INetFwPolicy2`), `network_config`.

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **Row shape is a key/value contract, not the YAML column list.** `result_parsing.hpp` clamps this plugin to two fields, so a `profile|Domain|enabled` row reaches the dashboard as key `profile`, value `Domain|enabled`. Splitting the value into its own axes is tracked under #626.
2. **macOS rules are the raw pf lines** and the pf reads need root; under the least-privilege model both `pf|` state and the rules list degrade to unknown or empty on purpose.
3. **The Linux unprivileged denial path is reasoned from the dispatch code, not measured on a live no-cap host.** The nftables leg was verified with `CAP_NET_ADMIN` present; on a non-firewalld host without that capability the probe falls through to `ufw`, then `iptables -S`, and a root-only iptables reports `backend|iptables` + `state|unknown`; `backend|none` only when no backend ran at all (neither binary exists, or `ufw` was refused and `iptables` is absent). Tracked for the Linux parity sweep. Linux troubleshooting tokens: `error|nftables:socket:eperm` means the netlink socket itself could not be opened or bound (EPERM/EACCES from `socket()`/`bind()`) — typically a hardened host's `systemd RestrictAddressFamilies=` omitting `AF_NETLINK`, or seccomp/AppArmor denying netlink; distinct from `error|nftables:table:eperm` (or `:chain:`/`:rule:`), which means the socket opened fine but the kernel refused a dump read — grant `CAP_NET_ADMIN` or run `firewalld` instead; `error|nftables:<dump>:timeout` means a dump did not finish inside its per-dump budget, typically a long-running nft transaction holding the table lock; `error|nftables:<dump>:foreign_flood` means another local process is writing to the same netlink family, drowning out the agent's own dump replies; `error|nftables:<dump>:errno:undecoded` means the kernel's `NLMSG_ERROR` reply itself couldn't be decoded (a short or anomalous payload) — treat it as an undiagnosed refusal, not errno 0; `truncated`/`oversized`/`io_error` mean the dump exceeded the read buffer, exceeded the 4 MiB size cap (a legitimately large enterprise ruleset can hit this; the ladder still falls through honestly to `ufw`/`iptables` rather than reporting a clipped count), or hit a raw socket/recv failure, respectively; `fallthrough|nftables:<dump>:torn` means a concurrent ruleset mutation interrupted the dump mid-read — routine on hosts running Docker or other frequent-reconfiguration workloads — and is not itself an error: the ladder continues to `ufw`/`iptables`. Note that an `error|nftables:table:<reason>` row can appear alongside a later successful `backend|ufw`/`backend|iptables` + `state|active` — the table-dump failure is reported the instant it happens, before the ladder has tried the next backend at all — so its presence alone does not mean every backend failed; only a terminal `state|unknown`/`rules|unknown` after it means no backend could answer.
4. **Windows rules stop at 100.** The `truncated|true` row is emitted only when a genuine 101st rule exists, so a host with exactly 100 rules is not marked truncated.
5. **A mixed fleet shows three macOS shapes.** Agents older than the Application Firewall change report pf as the sole state source (`backend|pf`); agents after that change but before the per-app list report `backend|appfirewall` plus a `pf|` row only; current agents add the unprivileged `app|` list, `anchor|` rows and the `ruleset|` count/`unknown` on top of that.
