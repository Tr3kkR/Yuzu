/**
 * tar_usage.hpp -- pure process-event pairing fold for the TAR `usage` source
 * (machine-scope app-usage aggregate), plus the fold's lifecycle contract.
 *
 * Architect decision: `usage` is a DERIVED FOLD over process_live on the fast
 * tick, NOT a CursorSource. Its persisted state is a high-water mark over
 * process_live.id plus an open-run table (usage_live) -- both advanced
 * transactionally by run_usage_fold() (tar_usage.cpp). This header is the
 * PURE half: no SQLite, no clock reads -- every function takes `now`
 * injected, matching tar_cursor.hpp's own now-injection shape, so the
 * pairing logic is fully exercised by test_tar_usage.cpp against fixture
 * ProcessEvent sequences with no DB and no wall clock.
 *
 * DRAIN ARITHMETIC (why the gap check in tar_usage.cpp is load-bearing):
 * the fast tick runs every 60s (tar_plugin.cpp kFastIntervalDefault) and
 * run_usage_fold caps itself at max_events_per_tick=20000 rows/tick, i.e.
 * ~333 events/s sustained before the fold starts trailing the write rate.
 * process_live holds up to 100k rows (kRowCount, tar_schema_registry.cpp);
 * its row-cap prune runs on the rollup cadence and deletes at most 5000 of
 * the LOWEST ids per pass (tar_aggregator.cpp run_retention). So a fold that
 * falls behind by more than the prune's per-pass headroom can find its next
 * unprocessed id already gone -- that is a genuine capture gap, and
 * tar_usage.cpp's MIN(id) check against the persisted high-water mark is the
 * honesty backstop for exactly that tail: it turns a silent skip into a
 * counted, reported loss (usage_gap_count / usage_gap_lost_events) rather
 * than an unnoticed hole in usage_daily.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE (Wave 7 PR7.2b redo -- replaces marker-existence with an explicit
 * state derived from three persisted facts, never written at boot/configure
 * time and never gated on the mere presence of a marker):
 *
 *   Disabled       -- `usage_enabled` is not "true" (canonical tri-state).
 *   PendingBaseline -- enabled, but `usage_active_generation` does not match
 *                      the current `usage_generation` (including: neither
 *                      has ever been written, or a read of either failed --
 *                      both fail TOWARD re-baselining, never toward Active).
 *   Active         -- enabled AND the two generations match: the fold's
 *                      cursor/open-run state was established under the
 *                      CURRENT activation period, not a stale one.
 *
 * `usage_generation` is bumped -- atomically, alongside the enabled flag --
 * on EVERY enable/disable edge (usage_set_enabled, tar_usage.cpp), so a
 * disable-then-re-enable always lands in PendingBaseline even if some other
 * code path never explicitly invalidates anything: the generation the LAST
 * successful baseline stamped can never match a NEWER one. This is what
 * makes "forward-only, no retrospective backfill across a disabled window"
 * (docs/user-manual/tar.md) a property of the STATE MACHINE rather than of
 * three independent marker-writing call sites (boot, configure, fast-tick)
 * each remembering to get it right -- exactly the shape that let the
 * original PR's boot-time rebaseline ignore `usage_enabled` entirely and
 * stamp a coverage marker even while disabled, so a later failed enable-edge
 * rebaseline replayed the whole disabled window forward from a stale marker.
 * `usage_ensure_baselined()` is the ONE function boot, configure, and every
 * fast tick all call to reconcile this state; none of them writes a marker
 * directly.
 *
 * exe_key normalisation: lowercase, basename after the last '/' or '\\',
 * trimmed of surrounding whitespace, empty -> "(unknown)". Windows keeps the
 * `.exe` suffix (never stripped). Linux `comm` (the `name` field ProcessEvent
 * carries for the process source) is already 15-char truncated by the kernel
 * before it ever reaches this function -- this function does not itself
 * truncate, so two Linux binaries whose names collide in the first 15 bytes
 * alias to the same exe_key; that is a kernel-imposed limit, not a defect
 * here. THIS FUNCTION IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the rule: the forthcoming
 * `app_usage` plugin's app_usage_parsers.hpp (agents/plugins/app_usage/src/,
 * not yet landed) is planned to duplicate it byte-for-byte, since that
 * plugin cannot depend on tar's internal headers -- when it lands, its own
 * parity test should pin the duplication, and any change here must be
 * mirrored there by hand.
