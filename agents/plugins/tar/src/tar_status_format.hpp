/**
 * Wire format for the `tar status` action's storage-health lines.
 *
 * Extracted from TarPlugin because that class is TU-local and therefore
 * untestable, and these particular lines are load-bearing in a way the rest of
 * the status output is not: the ORDER is a contract with the server.
 *
 * `tar status`'s output is consumed by `tar_tree_routes.cpp` (the capture-
 * sources frame) and by `poll_command`, which treats any non-empty output as
 * success and gates failure on `output.starts_with("error|")`. When the offline
 * report led with `storage_state|`, that gate missed, the frame fell through to
 * the capture-sources renderer -- which parses only `config|` lines -- and drew
 * all ten sources blank. A dead endpoint rendered identically to a healthy one,
 * on the one frame an operator opens to ask why a device's data is missing.
 *
 * So `error|` MUST come first on the offline path, and that is what this header
 * exists to let a test assert. See `tar.yaml` and `docs/user-manual/tar.md`.
