// tar_cursor.hpp -- the CURSOR-MODEL contract every subscription/cursor-backed
// TAR capture source (power, removable — wave 2) implements, plus the one new
// shared abstraction this seam introduces: a bounded, ack-after-commit pending
// queue for OS-callback-fed sources. This header is pure contract + a
// header-only template; it depends on nothing but tar_capture_status.hpp
// (IncompleteCaptureError) and the standard library, so it compiles standalone
// and is unit-testable without a live OS subscription (tests/unit/
// test_tar_cursor.cpp).
//
// WHY A SEPARATE MODEL FROM THE SNAPSHOT-DIFF SOURCES (service/mapdrive/arp) --
// those sources re-enumerate a full table every tick and diff it against the
// last COMPLETE snapshot (tar_capture_status.hpp's collect_or_retain). Power
// and removable-media events are OS-LOGGED TRANSITIONS (event-log records, a
// callback-fed subscription), not something to poll-and-diff: the source of
// truth is an append-only, possibly-wrapping log or a live callback stream,
// and what must be tracked between ticks is a POSITION in that log/stream
// (the "cursor"), not a snapshot of current state. Six load-bearing contract
// rules follow from that shape; every implementer (and this header's own
// driver code in tar_plugin.cpp) applies them identically:
//
//  1. TRANSIENT failure (the log/subscription could not be read this tick --
//     e.g. a locked/ACL-denied channel, a momentarily unreachable API) throws
//     IncompleteCaptureError (tar_capture_status.hpp:57), exactly like the
//     snapshot-diff sources. The driver (tar_plugin.cpp's collect_or_retain
//     usage) retains the cursor UNCHANGED and skips the persist for this tick
//     -- the same collect_or_retain policy documented at tar_capture_status.
//     hpp:187. This is a RETRY signal, not a data-loss signal: the next tick
//     re-reads from the same (unchanged) cursor.
//
//  2. A LOST/INVALID cursor -- the stored cursor references a log position
//     that no longer exists (the log WRAPPED past it, the subscription handle
//     is stale, the cursor JSON fails to parse) -- or a WRAPPED LOG detected
//     mid-read, is explicitly NOT an exception. It is a normal, expected
//     outcome: emit a `capture_gap` event recording the gap, RE-BASELINE the
//     cursor at the CURRENT log end (never replay-from-zero -- a full
//     from-zero replay of an OS event log/USB history is exactly the kind of
//     unbounded backfill this seam avoids), and return CursorOutcome::
//     CursorLost from collect(). The measured case this rule exists for:
//     the Wave 6 capture fixtures shows a Kernel-PnP/Configuration channel observed going
//     1432 -> 1352 records mid-capture (the provider recycled/wrapped the
//     channel) -- a real, not hypothetical, log-wrap.
//
//  3. Replay idempotence comes from the UNIQUE `record_key` column + INSERT OR
//     IGNORE (tar_db.hpp/.cpp), never from cursor arithmetic. A cursor that is
//     re-read from a slightly earlier position than strictly necessary (e.g.
//     after rule 2's re-baseline, or a retry) must never double-insert -- the
//     database's unique index is the single source of truth for "have I
//     already stored this event", not any offset math a source might do.
//
//     TWO INVARIANTS THIS PLACES ON YOU, because the store VERIFIES the claim
//     rather than trusting it. A key that is already present is only accepted
//     as a replay when the stored row's payload MATCHES; a differing payload is
//     a key collision, and the whole transaction is refused so the cursor
//     cannot advance past an event that was never stored. Therefore:
//
//     (a) EVERY FIELD YOU PERSIST MUST BE DETERMINISTICALLY RE-DERIVABLE from
//         the same OS record. Format a per-tick value -- a timestamp, a
//         "now", a counter, a duration -- into `detail`/`evidence` and the
//         re-offered event no longer matches itself, so it is refused EVERY
//         tick: the cursor never advances, and the whole batch, including
//         unrelated good events, is lost. `snapshot_id` is excluded from the
//         comparison for exactly this reason, and `ts` is excluded for a
//         `capture_gap` (see (b)); nothing else is.
//
//     (b) A `capture_gap`'s RECORD_KEY MUST ENCODE ITS WINDOW. Because `ts` is
//         excluded for gaps -- a gap's ts is "when we noticed", not identity --
//         two gaps sharing a key and a `detail` are the SAME gap. Encode the
//         bounds (`<leg>:restart:<since_ms>`), or ten distinct gaps collapse
//         into one while the cursor advances past all ten.
//
//     A source whose `collect()` cannot persist -- the atomic insert returns
//     false, from a full disk, SQLITE_BUSY, or the collision refusal above --
//     MUST throw IncompleteCaptureError rather than returning an outcome. The
//     driver's only channels are the outcome and `events_emitted`, so a
//     returned Advanced/Baseline after a failed persist reports a clean tick to
//     the operator while nothing was written. Rule 1's retain-and-retry path is
//     the correct response and the throw is what selects it.
//
//  4. Cursor state is PER-INPUT, carried inside one opaque, versioned JSON
//     blob (`{"v":1, ...}` -- the version lets a source evolve its internal
//     shape without a schema migration). A source with multiple independent
//     inputs (e.g. more than one event-log channel) packs all of them into
//     that single JSON document; tar_cursor stores exactly one row per source
//     name, never one row per input.
//
//  5. A RETROSPECTIVE source (one whose first read can reach into OS-retained
//     history from before the source was ever enabled) honours a
//     `<name>_lookback_seconds` config key -- default 604800 (7 days), and
//     0 = FORWARD-ONLY (no pre-enablement history is ever read). This is the
//     same operator-facing privacy control already shipped for netconn
//     (ADR-0020, netconn_lookback_seconds, tar_netconn.hpp) -- power and
//     removable follow the identical shape rather than inventing a second
//     one.
//
//  6. A subscription/callback-fed source must never DESTRUCTIVELY drain its
//     callback queue before the corresponding DB transaction commits (P-003).
//     BoundedPendingQueue below is the shared mechanism: push() is safe to
//     call from an OS callback thread, snapshot_batch() copies out a batch
//     without removing it, and ack_through(batch.last_seq) removes exactly the
//     entries that batch contained, BY SEQUENCE. There is deliberately no
//     positional ack(n): an overflow eviction between the snapshot and the ack
//     makes "the first n" a different n, which silently discards unacked
//     events (R-005). ack_through() must be called ONLY after the
//     event+cursor transaction
//     (insert_power_events_and_cursor / insert_removable_events_and_cursor)
//     has actually committed. A batch that fails to persist stays in the
//     queue and is retried next tick. This mirrors the existing pending_
//     stream_evs_ / kPendingStreamCap retry-on-insert-failure posture
//     (tar_plugin.cpp:1209) -- the difference is that here the seam OWNS the
//     bounded queue as a reusable template rather than every source
//     reimplementing its own std::vector-plus-cap dance.
//
// LIFECYCLE (P-002) -- a CursorSource is a TarPlugin-owned member (constructed
// once by make_cursor_sources(), started once, stopped once), NEVER a
// function-local static: a static registry cannot be torn down deterministically
// relative to TarDatabase's own lifetime, and this seam's #1 ordering
// requirement is that every source is fully stopped BEFORE the database it
// was writing to is destroyed (see stop() below).
//
//  - name()               -- the source name ("power", "removable"); doubles
//                             as the tar_cursor primary key and the
//                             `<name>_enabled` / `<name>_lookback_seconds`
//                             config-key prefix.
//  - start(db)             -- arm whatever OS subscription this source needs
//                             (an event-log handle, a device-notification
//                             callback, ...). A no-op for a pure-replay source
//                             that only reads a log on collect(). Called once,
//                             at plugin init, for every source (enabled or
//                             not) -- so a later on_enabled_changed(true) has
//                             something live to resume, mirroring the ETW
//                             process stream's "keep the session warm across
//                             a disable" posture (tar_plugin.cpp:1157).
//  - collect(db, cursor)   -- do one tick's read: given the last-persisted
//                             cursor (nullopt if never persisted), produce a
//                             CursorCollectResult. Throws IncompleteCaptureError
//                             per rule 1; returns CursorLost per rule 2;
//                             otherwise Baseline (no prior cursor -- this is
//                             the FIRST successful read) or Advanced.
//  - stop() noexcept       -- bounded unregister/drain/join of EVERY callback,
//                             queue, thread and OS handle the source owns. A
//                             source owns NOTHING live after stop() returns --
//                             no callback can fire, no thread can touch the
//                             database, after this call. Must be safe to call
//                             from shutdown() while collect_mu_ is held (so it
//                             must not itself try to take collect_mu_), and
//                             must be called for every constructed source
//                             BEFORE the TarDatabase is destroyed (tar_plugin.
//                             cpp shutdown() orders this exactly like
//                             proc_stream_/module_stream_ at tar_plugin.cpp:
//                             926-960: stop() every cursor source under
//                             collect_mu_, THEN db_.reset()).
//  - on_enabled_changed(en) -- the operator flips `<name>_enabled` (P-002 /
//                             forensic-pause parity with tar_plugin.cpp:1157):
//                               disable (en=false)  -- unregister the live
//                                 callback/subscription, OR (if it must stay
//                                 warm) drain-and-DISCARD whatever it already
//                                 buffered, so NOTHING from the paused window
//                                 is ever stored -- exactly the ETW process-
//                                 stream contract at tar_plugin.cpp:1157-1160.
//                               re-enable (en=true) -- RE-BASELINE forward (as
//                                 if this were a fresh CursorLost recovery: new
//                                 cursor at current log end) and emit a
