// tar_capture_status.hpp -- pure predicate for whether a bounded-subprocess
// capture is complete enough to trust as an authoritative TAR snapshot.
//
// Background: run_bounded_subprocess (agents/core/include/yuzu/agent/
// subprocess_runner.hpp) distinguishes "the child ran to completion" from
// "the deadline/output cap cut it off" via SubprocessResult::{tool_ran,
// timed_out, output_truncated, exit_code}. Several TAR collectors migrated
// from popen to that runner but kept the old popen-era check (only
// `tool_ran`), so a command that hit the deadline or the output cap still
// had its (partial) lines/output parsed and diffed against the previous
// COMPLETE snapshot -- fabricating durable "stopped"/"removed" forensic
// events for every row the partial run happened not to reach, followed by
// compensating false "started"/"appeared" events once a complete run
// replaces the partial one as the new baseline. This header is the single
// place that decision is made, so it is unit-testable without spawning a
// process (tests/unit/test_tar_service.cpp, tests/unit/test_tar_mapdrive.cpp)
// and every collector site applies the identical policy.
//
// zero_exit_required defaults to true because every command this repo wraps
// through the runner today (systemctl list-units, launchctl list, smbstatus
// -b, wevtutil qe, journalctl -u ... -n) is verified or documented to exit 0
// on a normal empty-result run -- see the call sites in
// tar_service_collector.cpp / tar_mapdrive_collector.cpp for what was
// verified on a live host versus assumed from documented behaviour. A future
// command whose *documented* success path is legitimately non-zero (this
// repo has been bitten by exactly that with `dnf check-update` exiting 100)
// must pass zero_exit_required=false at its own call site rather than
// weakening this default for everyone.
