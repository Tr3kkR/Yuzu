/**
 * Apply an enable/disable transition for a TAR capture source.
 *
 * Updates `<source>_enabled` to `new_value` and maintains the operator-facing
 * `<source>_paused_at` config row used by the TAR dashboard's
 * retention-paused list (PR-A / issue #547). The semantics are:
 *
 *   - enabled→disabled: writes `<source>_paused_at = now_epoch` AND clears the
 *     source's diff baseline (see #538 below).
 *   - disabled→enabled: writes `<source>_paused_at = "0"` (cleared, but kept
 *     present — a missing row would be ambiguous with "never paused").
 *   - no transition (idempotent set): leaves `<source>_paused_at` untouched.
 *
 * The default for `<source>_enabled` if not yet set is `"true"`, so the
 * first-ever set to `"false"` correctly registers as a transition.
 *
 * #538: on the enabled→disabled transition the source's snapshot-diff baseline
 * (`diff_state_key(source)`) is cleared so a later re-enable starts from a clean
 * snapshot instead of diffing against the frozen pre-pause state — which would
 * emit ghost "stopped" events for every entity that exited during the pause.
 * No-op for sources without a diff baseline (perf/procperf/netqual). The CALLER
 * must serialise this against the collectors (they hold `collect_mu_` for their
 * whole enumerate→diff→set_state cycle); this function takes no lock itself.
 *
 * @param db        The TAR database.
 * @param source    Source name (e.g. "process", "tcp", "service", "user").
 * @param new_value Either `"true"` or `"false"`. Other values are rejected
 *                  upstream by the configure action.
 * @param now_epoch Current epoch seconds — used as the paused_at timestamp.
