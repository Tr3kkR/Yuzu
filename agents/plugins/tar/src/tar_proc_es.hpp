/**
 * tar_proc_es.hpp — gap-free process start/stop capture via Endpoint Security.
 *
 * The macOS parity peer of tar_proc_etw.hpp. Subscribes an Endpoint Security
 * client to ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC (→ "started") and ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXIT
 * (→ "stopped") and decodes each message into the shared bounded ProcEventRing
 * that the TAR plugin drains and persists in batches. This is the event-driven
 * replacement for the sysctl(KERN_PROC_ALL) snapshot-diff poll: the poll misses
 * anything that starts AND exits within an interval and truncates names to the
 * kernel's 15-char p_comm; Endpoint Security does neither (gap-free, full image
 * path, accurate ppid, exit status).
 *
 * Streaming-source parity note: process is the ONLY TAR source Windows streams
 * (ETW); tcp/service/user poll on Windows too, so they stay polls on macOS. This
 * collector closes the one real streaming gap.
 *
 * Entitlement / privilege (hard requirements, mirrored from Apple's contract):
 *   - The host binary must carry com.apple.developer.endpoint-security.client
 *     (an Apple-restricted entitlement) and be signed + notarized for production.
 *   - es_new_client requires root (the macOS agent LaunchDaemon already runs as
 *     root). Without the entitlement / privilege, es_new_client returns
 *     ERR_NOT_ENTITLED / ERR_NOT_PRIVILEGED and start() returns false — the caller
 *     falls back to the existing sysctl poll cleanly.
 * For dev validation on a SIP-disabled / amfi-bypassed host, an unentitled signed
 * binary can create a client; production ship is gated on the entitlement grant.
 *
 * Boot gap (known limitation, parity with ETW): a live client only sees events
 * once it is running, so processes already alive when the agent starts get no
 * "started" row until they exit. macOS has no AutoLogger .etl equivalent and the
 * collector does NOT seed a startup baseline — no worse than the snapshot-diff
 * poll it replaces, whose first tick likewise emits no "started" for the
 * already-running set.
 *
 * EndpointSecurity / libbsm headers are confined to the .cpp (pimpl). Off-macOS
 * every method is a no-op: start() returns false, the ring stays empty, drain()
 * yields nothing — callers degrade cleanly.
