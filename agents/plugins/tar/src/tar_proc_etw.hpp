/**
 * tar_proc_etw.hpp — gap-free process start/stop capture via ETW.
 *
 * Thread 1(a) of the ETW process-events workstream. Subscribes to the
 * Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process provider on a real-time ETW session and
 * decodes process start (event id 1) / stop (event id 2) into a bounded ring
 * buffer that the TAR plugin drains and persists in batches. This is the
 * event-driven complement to the snapshot-diff poll (CreateToolhelp32Snapshot /
 * NtQuerySystemInformation): the poll misses anything that starts and exits
 * within an interval; ETW does not.
 *
 * Boot gap (known limitation, thread 1(b)): a real-time session only sees events
 * once it is open, so processes that start AND exit before the agent's session
 * starts are missed. The fix is an AutoLogger that buffers boot events to an
 * .etl the agent drains at startup — a separate slice.
 *
 * windows.h-free by design: all ETW / TDH / windows.h usage lives in the .cpp
 * (mirrors guard.hpp's discipline — keeps windows.h's ERROR/min/max macros out
 * of headers). Off-Windows the collector is a no-op: start() returns false, the
 * ring stays empty, drain() yields nothing — callers degrade cleanly.
 *
 * The `ProcEvent` value type and the `ProcEventRing` push→pull bridge are shared
 * with the macOS Endpoint Security collector and live in tar_proc_stream.hpp.
