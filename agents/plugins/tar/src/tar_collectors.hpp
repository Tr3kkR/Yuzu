/**
 * tar_collectors.hpp -- Data types and diff engine for TAR collectors
 *
 * Defines the data structures for each collector type (process, network,
 * service, user session) and the diff functions that compare snapshots
 * to produce TarEvent records for births, deaths, and state changes.
 *
 * Diff algorithm: uses std::unordered_map with composite keys.
 *   - "Birth" = present in current but not in previous
 *   - "Death" = present in previous but not in current
 *   - "State change" = same key, different status field (services only)
 *
 * Command-line redaction: Before storing process events, cmdline is checked
 * against configurable case-insensitive substring patterns (default: *password*, *secret*, *token*,
 * *api_key*, *credential*). Matching cmdlines are replaced with
 * "[REDACTED by TAR]".
