/**
 * wol_check_plan.hpp — pure mechanism-selection logic for wol's `check`
 * action (ADR-3002 acquisition-ladder migration: rung-1 native ICMP +
 * TCP-connect fallback, replacing a popen'd `ping`).
 *
 * `check`'s contract is "is this host now reachable" (polled after a `wake`
 * to see whether the target woke up). Two probe mechanisms can answer that:
 *   - ICMP echo (yuzu::shared::IcmpSession, agents/shared/icmp_probe.hpp) —
 *     the primary, most authoritative signal when available.
 *   - A TCP connect on kFallbackTcpPort (yuzu::shared::tcp_sample, same
 *     header) — the pragmatic fallback for hosts/kernels that drop or deny
 *     unprivileged ICMP (e.g. Linux net.ipv4.ping_group_range), mirroring
 *     netprobe_plugin.cpp's own TCP-fallback shape (do_tcp, default port
 *     443 — the single most commonly-open TCP port across server and
 *     desktop fleets, needing no operator configuration).
 *
 * classify_check() below is the ONE place that decides the reported
 * verdict from what actually happened during a probe attempt. It is pure
 * (no I/O, no context) so it's fixture-testable without a live network hop
 * — the netprobe_stats.hpp pattern. The critical invariant it enforces:
 * a denied/unavailable ICMP session falling back to a usable TCP check is
 * an ordinary, expected degrade (CheckMechanism::tcp_fallback) — but if
 * NEITHER mechanism could even be attempted, the verdict is
 * CheckMechanism::unavailable, which the caller reports as an honest
 * CONSTRAINED/UNAVAILABLE result status, never a fabricated "unreachable".
 * Silently reporting "unreachable" when the truth is "we couldn't check at
 * all" would read to an operator as "the WoL wake failed" when it may well
 * have succeeded.
