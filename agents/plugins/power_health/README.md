| **What it does** | Battery, thermal, and power-plan inventory, plus a gated power-plan switch |
| **Version** | 1.0.0 |
| **Kind** | Collector + Action · read-only (`battery`, `thermal`, `power_plan`) + mutating (`set_power_plan`) · on-demand (`gather.ttlSeconds` is a response-cache TTL only; no scheduled runner) |
| **Platforms** | Windows 🟡 mixed (constrained: `thermal`) · macOS 🟡 mixed (constrained: `thermal`; unsupported: `power_plan`, `set_power_plan`) · Linux 🟡 mixed (constrained: `battery`, `thermal`; `power_plan`/`set_power_plan` not implemented) |
| **Actions** | `battery` (definition `crossplatform.power.battery`) · `thermal` (`crossplatform.power.thermal`) · `power_plan` (`crossplatform.power.power_plan`) · `set_power_plan` (`crossplatform.power.set_power_plan`) |
| **Security** | `battery`/`thermal`/`power_plan`: securable `Inventory` · operation Read · risk Low · dispatch ReadOnly · approval gate none — `set_power_plan`: securable `PowerManagement` · operation Write · risk Medium · dispatch Destructive · approval gate AdminOrApproval |
| **Roles** | `battery`/`thermal`/`power_plan`: execute endpoint-admin, endpoint-operator · author content-author — `set_power_plan`: execute endpoint-admin · author content-author |

## How it works

`battery` enumerates power sources and classifies each into a closed state set (`charging`/`discharging`/`full`/`not_charging`/`ac_no_battery`/`unknown`) from `GetSystemPowerStatus`+`CallNtPowerInformation` (Windows), `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo`/`IOPSCopyPowerSourcesList` (macOS), or `/sys/class/power_supply` uevent parsing (Linux). `thermal` reads per-zone Celsius on Windows (PDH) and Linux (sysfs), or macOS's 4-level thermal-pressure enum (`NSProcessInfo.thermalState`, never a temperature) supplemented by `IOPMGetThermalWarningLevel`. `power_plan` enumerates named Windows power schemes (PowrProf) and which is active; macOS has no named schemes so it is unsupported, and Linux support is declared but not implemented. `set_power_plan` is the plugin's only mutating action: it resolves the `scheme` parameter to exactly one live scheme, reads the prior active scheme, calls `PowerSetActiveScheme`, then reads back and verifies the switch took — every branch before the set call is guaranteed to leave the system unmutated, and a failure after the set call reports the final state as unknown rather than falsely claiming it is unchanged.

Deliberately not: macOS battery never reads the `AppleSmartBattery` IORegistry node, which is present and active even on battery-less Mac minis and would report a phantom battery; Windows never uses WMI, `powercfg`, or COM for any action; a PDH zero-instance thermal read is reported as an explicit `no_thermal_zones_exposed` success, never an error or a fabricated zero.

**Declared limits per leg** (the descriptor's fallback text, verbatim):

- **`battery` / Windows** — no-system-battery path measured live on the-rig (BatteryFlag=128); the battery-PRESENT path is now verified on real hardware (HP ZBook Firefly, PR #4009 review), which is what caught the AC-resting state being reported as unknown rather than not_charging.
- **`battery` / macOS** — IOPS is used deliberately over the AppleSmartBattery IORegistry node, which is present, matched and active even on a battery-less Mac mini and would report a phantom battery; the battery-PRESENT path is fixture-tested and UNVERIFIED on real Mac battery hardware — the run host was a desktop.
- **`battery` / Linux** — fixture-verified; no live Linux venue in this run.
- **`thermal` / Windows** — zero live counter instances is the measured normal case on desktop hardware (the-rig, 2026-09-04); reports no_thermal_zones_exposed as an explicit success, never an error or a fabricated zero.
- **`thermal` / macOS** — reports a 4-level thermal-pressure enum, never a temperature reading.
- **`thermal` / Linux** — fixture-verified; no live Linux venue in this run.
- **`power_plan` / Windows** — 4 schemes verified live on the-rig, 2026-09-04 (agrees with powercfg /list).
- **`power_plan` / macOS** — macOS has no named power schemes; IOPMSetPMPreferences is SPI — not adopted.
- **`power_plan` / Linux** — declared only; not implemented in this package.
- **`set_power_plan` / macOS** — macOS has no named power schemes; IOPMSetPMPreferences is SPI — not adopted.
- **`set_power_plan` / Linux** — declared only; not implemented in this package.

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | None — `GetSystemPowerStatus`/`CallNtPowerInformation`/PDH/PowrProf calls need no elevated right; `set_power_plan`'s `PowerManagement.Write`/AdminOrApproval requirement is an application-level RBAC/approval gate, not an OS privilege | captured 2026-09-07 as `SYSTEM` (`docs/samples/windows.txt`) | `battery`: result status `UNAVAILABLE`, "GetSystemPowerStatus failed" (`power_health_plugin.cpp:247`); `thermal` failures are typed per-branch but leave result status `UNDECLARED` (see Result status) |
| macOS | agent daemon, dedicated unprivileged account by design (`docs/agent-privilege-model.md:12`) | None — `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo`/`List` and `NSProcessInfo`/`IOPMGetThermalWarningLevel` are public frameworks needing no entitlement | captured 2026-09-07 at euid 501, unprivileged (`docs/samples/macos.txt`) | `battery`: an empty power-source list is reported as a genuine empty result, never a permission error (`power_health_plugin.cpp:274-283`) |
| Linux | dedicated unprivileged account (`yuzu`), never root by design (`docs/agent-privilege-model.md:12`) | None — `/sys/class/power_supply` and `/sys/class/thermal` are normally world-readable | captured 2026-09-06 at euid 0 in a container (`docs/samples/linux.txt`) — a more privileged posture than the intended unprivileged design | `battery`: result status `CONSTRAINED`, "/sys/class/power_supply not readable" (`power_health_plugin.cpp:288`); `thermal`: row reports `unavailable`/`sys_class_thermal_not_readable` but result status stays `UNDECLARED` (`power_health_plugin.cpp:457-463`) |

No external binaries, no subprocesses, no network access — "no WMI, no powercfg or any subprocess, no COM/CoInitialize* anywhere" (`power_health_plugin.cpp:58-59`); no `popen`/`CreateProcess`/socket call appears in any of the plugin's three source files.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
| Action | Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `set_power_plan` | `scheme` | string | yes | — | Target power scheme — a GUID, or a friendly name that must match exactly one live scheme (case-insensitive); max 256 characters |

`battery`, `thermal`, and `power_plan` take no parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited rows via `write_output()`, one line per record. `thermal`'s field count varies by row (see below); every other action's row has a fixed field count. `-` marks an absent field, never an empty one.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen outputs -->
**`battery` — `battery|present|state|percent|time_to_empty_min|cycle_count|health_percent`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `present` | boolean | true, false | W, M, L | `false` |
| `state` | string | `charging` `discharging` `full` `not_charging` `ac_no_battery` `unknown` | W, M, L | `ac_no_battery` |
| `percent` | int64 | 0-100 or `-1` (unknown) | W, M, L | `-1` |
| `time_to_empty_min` | int64 | non-negative or `-1` (unknown) | W, M, L | `-1` |
| `cycle_count` | int64 | non-negative or `-1` (unknown / not exposed) | L only (Windows/macOS have no source) | `-1` |
| `health_percent` | int64 | 0-100 or `-1` (unknown / not exposed) | L only (Windows/macOS have no source) | `-1` |

**`thermal` — `thermal|status|zone_or_detail|celsius`** (`celsius` is omitted entirely, not `-`, on any non-ok row and on every macOS row; an ok row with real zones repeats one row per zone)

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `ok` `constrained` `unavailable` | W, M, L | `ok` |
| `zone_or_detail` | string | zone/sensor name (W/L ok row), `nominal`\|`fair`\|`serious`\|`critical` (M ok row), or a fixed failure/constrained token | W, M, L | `nominal` |
| `celsius` | number | decimal degrees Celsius; field absent otherwise | W, L only, and only on an ok row with a real zone | no sample captured this field |

**`power_plan` — `power_plan|guid|friendly_name|active|status`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `guid` | string | GUID string, or `-` | W only | `381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e` |
| `friendly_name` | string | free text (operator-settable), or `-` | W only | `Balanced` |
| `active` | string | `"0"` `"1"` `"-"` (unknown; every scheme enumerated but the active read failed) | W, M, L | `1` |
| `status` | string | `ok` `timeout` `enumeration_incomplete` `no_schemes_enumerated` `active_unknown` `unsupported_on_macos` `planned_not_implemented` | W, M, L | `ok` |

**`set_power_plan` — `set_power_plan|status|reason|previous_guid|new_guid`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `ok`, `error` | W, M, L | `error` |
| `reason` | string | `missing_param` `timeout` `enumeration_incomplete` `ambiguous` `no_match` `read_prior_failed` `set_failed` `readback_failed` `readback_mismatch` `unsupported_on_macos` `planned_not_implemented`, or `-` | W, M, L | `missing_param` |
| `previous_guid` | string | GUID string, or `-` | W only | `-` |
| `new_guid` | string | GUID string, or `-` | W only | `-` |
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Result status

`do_thermal` never calls `set_result_status` on any platform or branch — its typed outcome lives only in the row's own `status`/`detail` fields. `do_battery` calls it on exactly one failure path (Windows `GetSystemPowerStatus` failure); every other battery branch, including a clean read and a genuinely-empty result, is also `UNDECLARED`.

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UNAVAILABLE` | partial | "GetSystemPowerStatus failed" | Windows `battery`: the Win32 call itself failed |
| `CONSTRAINED` | partial | "/sys/class/power_supply not readable" | Linux `battery`: the sysfs directory could not be opened |
| `CONSTRAINED` | partial | "bounded_call timed out enumerating power schemes" / "PowerEnumerate ended on a non-terminal error; inventory is incomplete" / "failed to read the active scheme; active flag is unknown for every row" | Windows `power_plan`: enumeration timeout, incomplete enumeration, or active-scheme read failure |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | partial | "macOS has no named power schemes…" / "power_plan is PLANNED…not implemented" | macOS/Linux `power_plan`: always (no mutation, no enumeration) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | partial | one of `missing_param`/`timeout`/`enumeration_incomplete`/`ambiguous`/`no_match`/`read_prior_failed`/`set_failed`/`readback_failed`/`readback_mismatch` | Windows `set_power_plan`: every failure branch |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | partial | "macOS has no named power schemes; no mutation attempted" / "…PLANNED on Linux…no mutation attempted" | macOS/Linux `set_power_plan`: always |
| `OK` | full | — | Windows `set_power_plan`: the mutation was applied and the read-back verified it |
| `UNDECLARED` | — | — | `thermal` on every platform and branch; `battery` on every branch except the one Windows failure above (including a clean read on any platform, and Windows `power_plan`'s successful enumeration path) — the agent records `UNDECLARED`/`UNKNOWN`, exactly as every sample below shows |

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result only.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response and land in the ResponseStore, queryable at `/api/responses/{id}`.
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync inventory, the TAR warehouse, DEX, or metrics — a grep of `server/core/src` for `power_health`/`crossplatform.power` finds only the capability-catalogue registration and the `PowerManagement` RBAC securable seed (`server/core/src/rbac_store.cpp:582`, `server/core/src/server.cpp:138,22119`), no sync-source or TAR consumer. `gather.ttlSeconds` (300s reads, 60s `set_power_plan`) is a response-cache TTL, not a scheduled dispatch.
- **Siblings:** none — this is the fleet's only power-state source.
- **MCP / REST.** Discover: `discover_plugins` (summary) → `yuzu://plugin-docs` (this page as data) → `discover_instructions` / `get_definition("crossplatform.power.battery")`. Run: `execute_instruction {definition_id, parameters}`. Read: `/api/responses/{id}`.

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **`battery` and `thermal` never set a typed result status.** `do_thermal` has no `set_result_status` call on any platform (`power_health_plugin.cpp:320-493`), and `do_battery` calls it only on the single Windows `GetSystemPowerStatus`-failure branch (`:247`) — every other battery/thermal branch, clean reads included, stays `UNDECLARED`/`UNKNOWN`, exactly as all three samples above show.
2. **The Windows battery-PRESENT path was fixed only after a real hardware run.** A present battery resting on AC below 100% was originally classified `unknown`; PR #4009's HP ZBook Firefly review caught the firmware charge-hold case and it now reports `not_charging` (`power_health_parsers.hpp:174-181`). The equivalent macOS branch (`:244-252`) is still fixture-only and UNVERIFIED on real battery hardware.
3. **`thermal`'s row shape differs by platform and status.** A non-ok row omits the `celsius` field entirely (`thermal|status|detail`), an ok row with real zones repeats one row per zone (`thermal|ok|name|celsius`), and macOS's ok row is always the 3-field form carrying the pressure level instead of a zone name (`power_health_parsers.hpp:361-375`; macOS sample: `thermal|ok|nominal`) — no sample in this package captures a numeric Celsius value.
4. **`set_power_plan` guarantees no mutation on every pre-set failure, but a post-set failure leaves state genuinely unknown.** `MissingParam`/`Timeout`/`EnumerationIncomplete`/`Ambiguous`/`NoMatch`/`ReadPriorFailed` are all pre-mutation; `SetFailed`/`ReadbackFailed`/`ReadbackMismatch` deliberately do NOT claim "unchanged" because the mutation may already be applied — `previous_guid` is still emitted so the caller can revert manually (`power_health_parsers.hpp:658-681`, `power_health_plugin.cpp:670-705`). It is the first Destructive+Reversible row in the catalogue and is allowlisted by name in `tests/unit/server/test_capability_catalogue.cpp:180`.
5. **Linux `power_plan`/`set_power_plan` are declared, not implemented; macOS is unsupported by design.** Linux is PLANNED (`platform_profile`); macOS has no named power schemes and `IOPMSetPMPreferences` is SPI, deliberately not adopted (`power_health_plugin.cpp:729-755`). The Linux capture in this package ran at euid 0 in a container — more privileged than the agent's intended unprivileged posture (`docs/agent-privilege-model.md:12`) — so it is not representative of production privilege.
