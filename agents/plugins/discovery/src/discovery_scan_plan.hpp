/**
 * discovery_scan_plan.hpp — the pure decisions behind `scan_subnet`
 * (Wave-2 PR2.1c, WP-C). Portable and header-only: this file and its test TU
 * (test_discovery_scan_plan.cpp) carry no platform guard and run on every leg.
 *
 * `do_scan_subnet` used to bury three honesty-critical decisions inside an
 * untestable shell (a live ICMP socket + a real ARP table + a wall clock), so
 * nothing proved them. They are free functions here instead — the repo's
 * "pure core, thin shell" discipline — leaving the plugin's own code to do
 * only the I/O the unit suites never run:
 *
 *   classify_icmp_session() — the three session states the sweep must handle,
 *       derived from IcmpSession's {ok, permitted} pair.
 *   degrade_for()           — session state -> ABI4 result status, completeness
 *       and machine-readable reason. This is the "never a silent empty result,
 *       never a fake 100% loss" contract: a denied socket must report
 *       CONSTRAINED/PARTIAL, not a successful scan of a dead network.
 *   probe_budget_ms()       — the per-host ICMP budget. The bound that keeps a
 *       /24 sweep finite: 254 hosts * kMaxProbeBudgetMs is the worst case, and
 *       it must stay well inside the caller's overall scan deadline.
 *   arp_hosts_in_subnet()   — confines an ARP-derived fallback host set to the
 *       subnet actually requested, so a degraded scan never reports unrelated
 *       cached neighbours (other subnets, broadcast, multicast) as findings.
