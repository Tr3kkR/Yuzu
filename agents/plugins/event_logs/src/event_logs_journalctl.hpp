// event_logs_journalctl.hpp -- pure outcome classifier for the Linux rung-2
// `journalctl` argv fallback (Wave-4 PR4.2).
//
// Deliberately the same shape as event_logs_macos.hpp's
// classify_log_show_result: a free function over a SubprocessResult, no I/O of
// its own, so every reachable (termination_reason, exit_code, timed_out)
// combination is fixture-testable on every host. The Linux leg previously made
// this decision inline in event_logs_plugin.cpp's anonymous namespace, where it
// could not be tested -- and an untested inline version shipped two successive
// honesty holes (a missing exit-code check, then a missing signal check) before
// this header existed. The classifier is the tested part; the shell just emits
// what it returns.
