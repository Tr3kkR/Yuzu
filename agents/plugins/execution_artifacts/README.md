## How it works

All three actions are independent Windows-only reads, dispatched and gated separately — a failure in one never blocks the other two. `shimcache` opens `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache` and decodes the Windows 10/11 AppCompatCache blob into one row per cached executable path, last-modified time, and data size; this layout carries no execution-confirmation bit, so `insert_flag` is always `-`. `amcache` copies `Amcache.hve` (plain `CopyFileW` first, falling back to a `SeBackupPrivilege` + backup-semantics read only on a sharing violation), loads the copy privately and read-only via `RegLoadAppKeyW`, and enumerates every `Root\InventoryApplicationFile` subkey into a row of path, SHA-1, size, link date, publisher, binary type, and product identity. `prefetch` globs `C:\Windows\Prefetch\*.pf`, MAM-decompresses each file via `ntdll`'s `RtlDecompressBufferEx`, and parses the Windows 10/11 (version 31) file-information layout into exe name, hash, run count, up to eight last-run timestamps, and volume/file-reference counts. None of the three ever reads or emits file contents — only paths, hashes, and timestamps. Every action authorizes at `Forensics:Read`/`AdminOrApproval`, is refused for anything but a single explicit target, and is DEFAULT-OFF behind the server-side plugin-config kill switch until an operator explicitly enables it.

| Action | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| `amcache` | 🟡 constrained · rung 1 · copy Amcache.hve(+.LOG1/.LOG2) then RegLoadAppKeyW; whole sequence serialised by offline_hive_mutex | ⛔ unsupported | ⛔ unsupported |

**Declared limits per leg** (descriptor fallback text, verbatim):

- **`amcache` / Windows** — A1's the-rig probe (2026-09-06) found the copy succeeds as a PLAIN Copy-Item in every session tested (admin and LocalSystem) — the sharing violation that would require CreateFile(FILE_SHARE_READ|WRITE|DELETE, FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS) + SeBackupPrivilege was never hit, so that fallback path is unexercised on this hardware. RegLoadAppKeyW does NOT require SeBackupPrivilege: it succeeded (LSTATUS 0x00000000) with the privilege explicitly disabled via AdjustTokenPrivileges, in both the admin session and under LocalSystem, against all 8889 real InventoryApplicationFile subkeys. Reported CONSTRAINED because the plain-copy path is a best-effort acquisition method not guaranteed on every host (a locked/exclusively-held hive on another machine could still need the backup-semantics fallback), not because anything failed on the probe host
- **`amcache` / macOS** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists
- **`amcache` / Linux** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists
- **`prefetch` / Windows** — A1's the-rig LocalSystem probe (2026-09-06): GetProcAddress resolved both ntdll entry points to non-null addresses in every session (admin and LocalSystem); all four decompression attempts across the three real MAM .pf captures returned NTSTATUS 0x00000000 (STATUS_SUCCESS) from both RtlGetCompressionWorkSpaceSize (workspace size 166495 bytes, format COMPRESSION_FORMAT_XPRESS_HUFF, engine standard) and RtlDecompressBufferEx, with every decompressed payload's bytes 4-7 reading 'SCCA'. Real captures parsed as prefetch format version 31 (Windows 10/11), not version 30 as originally planned — see execution_artifacts_parsers.hpp's file header
- **`prefetch` / macOS** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists
- **`prefetch` / Linux** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists
- **`shimcache` / Windows** — Windows 10/11 layout only ('win10' header scheme, DWORD 0x34 or 0x30); no exec-flag bit exists in this layout, so every row's insert_flag is '-'. A1's real capture (the-rig, 2026-09-06) was 7886 bytes, well under the 16 MiB bound, and parsed with the header-size DWORD reading 0x34
- **`shimcache` / macOS** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists
- **`shimcache` / Linux** — Windows-only artefact; no equivalent exists

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | None for `shimcache` (a bounded `HKLM` value read) or `prefetch` (a directory glob plus per-file reads under `C:\Windows\Prefetch`). `amcache` needs no elevation either: A1's the-rig probe found `RegLoadAppKeyW` succeeds without `SeBackupPrivilege`, in both an admin session and under LocalSystem; the `SeBackupPrivilege` + backup-semantics fallback (reached only on `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION`) exists for a host where the hive is exclusively locked elsewhere, but grants itself no new privilege beyond what the service account can already request. | A1's the-rig probe, 2026-09-06, admin session and LocalSystem (see this plugin's `execution_artifacts_win.cpp` file header for the full probe findings) | `constrained` with a named reason (`reg_<code>`, `hive_locked`, `regload_<code>`, `subkey_open_failed`, …) — this plugin does not distinguish "access denied" from "not found"/"vanished mid-walk" in its tokens; a refused open and a missing key report through the same per-source token family |
| macOS | n/a — plugin loads but every action is the fixed `windows_only_artefact` outcome | n/a | not measured (no macOS mechanism exists) | always `unsupported` / `windows_only_artefact`, rc 1 |
| Linux | n/a — plugin loads but every action is the fixed `windows_only_artefact` outcome | n/a | not measured (no Linux mechanism exists) | always `unsupported` / `windows_only_artefact`, rc 1 |

No external binaries, no subprocesses, no network access — every call is an in-process Win32 registry/file call or an in-process `ntdll` decompression call. This plugin performs no authorization of its own: `Forensics:Read`/`AdminOrApproval`/single-target enforcement lives at the server dispatch layer (`server/core/src/dispatch_destructive_gate.hpp`), and every read is additionally gated behind the server-side plugin-config kill switch (`PluginConfigStore::seed_kill_switch_default_off`), which is OFF until an operator explicitly enables it.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
No action takes parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited rows, one discriminator-prefixed row per artefact entry (`shimcache|...`, `amcache|...`, `prefetch|...`); every untrusted string field is escaped through `safe_output_field`. A source that fails outright never emits a row — it emits `constrained|<token>` instead and sets the matching typed status. A source that reads some entries and fails on others (Amcache's per-subkey walk, Prefetch's per-file walk) emits every row it could read, plus one `constrained|<reason>` line (Amcache, when the walk itself was truncated) or one `prefetch_error|<file>|<reason>` line per skipped file (Prefetch, when the walk completed but individual files failed), and folds every accumulated reason into the terminal typed status through the shared `ConstraintAccumulator`. Amcache additionally emits `note|malformed_fileid_count=<n>` when one or more `FileId` values could not be normalised to a 40-hex-character SHA-1, and either leg's temp-file cleanup emits `note|temp_cleanup_failed` on a (non-fatal) deletion failure — both `note|` lines are diagnostic, not data rows, and a consumer parsing `amcache|` rows skips any line that does not start with that discriminator. `shimcache`'s `insert_flag` is always `-` (no execution-confirmation bit exists in the Windows 10/11 AppCompatCache layout); every other field is either the artefact's real decoded value or absent (`-`) when that specific field could not be read.

### Result status

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` | full | *(empty)* | `shimcache`: the AppCompatCache value opened, read within the 16 MiB bound, and parsed to at least one row. `amcache`: every enumerated subkey and value read cleanly, no cap hit. `prefetch`: every `.pf` file was enumerated, read, decompressed and parsed with no per-file error and no cap hit. |
| `OK` | partial | `file_oversized` · `read_failed` · `ntdll_symbol_missing` · `ntstatus_<hex>` · `bad_magic` · `truncated_header` · `unknown_version` · `truncated_entry` · `oversize_count` · `bad_path_length` (comma-joined when several fire) | `prefetch` only: the directory enumeration completed in full but one or more individual `.pf` files failed to open, read, decompress or parse; each failed file is already on the stream as its own `prefetch_error\|<file>\|<reason>` row, so the run is reported as a degraded success rather than a failure — one truncated file must never fail every other good row. |
| `CONSTRAINED` | partial | `shimcache`: `reg_<code>` · `oversized` · `reg_changed_during_read` · `shimcache_empty` · `bad_magic` · `truncated_header` · `unknown_version` · `truncated_entry` · `oversize_count` · `bad_path_length` · `internal_error`. `amcache`: `data_dir_unset` · `dest_dir_create_<code>` · `dest_dir_open_<code>` · `dest_dir_acl` · `hive_missing` · `hive_oversized` · `hive_locked` · `win32_<code>` · `hive_short_write` · `regload_<code>` · `amcache_root_missing` · `subkey_cap` · `enum_<code>` · `subkey_open_failed` · `value_enum_incomplete` · `value_read_failed` · `amcache_empty` · `internal_error` (comma-joined; `amcache_empty` is always composed with any other accumulated reason via `reason_with`, never reported alone when a real cause is known). `prefetch`: `prefetch_disabled` · `prefetch_enum_<code>` · `file_cap` · `byte_cap` · `internal_error` (plus any of the `OK`/partial per-file tokens above, accumulated alongside a cap). | `shimcache`: the key/value could not be opened or read, the blob exceeded the 16 MiB cap, changed mid-read, parsed to zero rows, failed header parsing, or an unexpected exception was caught. `amcache`: `agent.data_dir` was never configured for this host (`data_dir_unset`); its per-dispatch random scratch directory could not be created (`dest_dir_create_<code>`) or could not be re-opened as a handle immediately afterward (`dest_dir_open_<code>`); or that freshly-created directory failed an owner/reparse-point safety check proving it is really the object this process just created (`dest_dir_acl`) — otherwise the hive could not be found, copied, size-checked, loaded, or enumerated within `kAmcacheMaxSubkeys` (20000), or an unexpected exception was caught. `prefetch`: the Prefetch directory could not be enumerated, or the per-file-count (2048) or total-byte (256 MiB) cap truncated the walk before every file was seen, or an unexpected exception was caught. |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | partial | `windows_only_artefact` | All three actions, on every non-Windows build — this plugin has no macOS or Linux mechanism for ShimCache, Amcache, or Prefetch; the fixed fallback reports this token and rc 1 without attempting any OS call. |

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result only.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response, land in the ResponseStore, and are queryable at `/api/responses/{id}` — single-target only; fleet or scope targeting is refused at the server dispatch layer before this plugin ever runs.
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync inventory, the TAR warehouse, DEX, or metrics. Nothing here runs on a schedule; each action dispatches only when an operator or workflow explicitly requests it, and only once the plugin-config kill switch is enabled.
- **Sensitivity.** ShimCache/Amcache/Prefetch rows are forensic evidence: real executable paths (which may embed a Windows profile/username segment), Amcache's SHA-1 hashes and product/publisher identity, and Prefetch's precise run counts and last-run timestamps together let a reader reconstruct what software ran on a single named machine and when — the kind of evidence an incident responder pulls during an active investigation, and exactly what an unauthorized reader could use to fingerprint a target's activity. No row ever carries file contents.
- **Siblings:** `app_usage` (planned, same `Forensics:Read`/`AdminOrApproval` boundary) and `autoruns` (persistence-point evidence) are the other execution/activity-evidence sources in the catalogue; none share a store or a format with this plugin.
- **MCP / REST.** Discover: `discover_plugins` (summary) → `yuzu://plugin-docs` (this page as data) → `discover_instructions` / `get_definition("windows.execution_artifacts.shimcache")`. Run: `execute_instruction {definition_id, parameters}` (single explicit `agent_id` required). Read: `/api/responses/{id}`.

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **Prefetch v17 (Windows XP/2003) is deliberately rejected, not decoded.** Its magic/header shape resembles v23's (Vista/7) closely enough that treating it as "close enough" would silently misparse a real v17 file using the wrong field offsets — worse than reporting `unknown_version`. Re-adding it needs its own byte-level capture, the way v23/26/30/31 were bound against real fixtures. Separately, v23/26's volume-entry stride (104 bytes, per libscca) is documentation-derived, not byte-verified against a real capture — every real fixture on this hardware is v31 (96-byte stride, verified against real two-volume files). A NATURALLY wrong stride for v23/26 fails closed (`truncated_entry`/`oversize_count`) rather than fabricating a count — both reviewers of PR #4444's round-3 review independently confirmed this in both directions — but this is not an unconditional guarantee: a deliberately crafted file can still coincidentally satisfy every bounds/size/version check at the wrong offset and produce a fabricated success (issue #4467 tracks this as a permanent, documented residual and its regression test). The realistic risk is low — the adversarial case needs SYSTEM/admin-tier write access to `C:\Windows\Prefetch\`, a privilege tier that already has far more direct ways to feed this plugin bad data.
2. **Amcache's `SeBackupPrivilege` + backup-semantics fallback is unexercised on real hardware.** A1's the-rig probe (2026-09-06) found a plain `CopyFileW` always sufficient — `RegLoadAppKeyW` never needed the privilege, in an admin session or under LocalSystem, against all 8889 real subkeys — so the `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` fallback path exists only for a host where the hive is genuinely exclusively locked elsewhere, and that path itself has not been probed. Separately: some `amcache` rows legitimately carry an empty path/size/date/publisher/binary-type/product fields, non-empty `FileId` only — root-caused live on the-rig (2026-09-17) via `reg load`+`reg query` against a copy of the real hive: several `InventoryApplicationFile` subkeys (observed for built-in driver files, e.g. `1394kdbg.sys`/`1394ohci.sys`) genuinely carry only `ProgramId`+`FileId` in the registry itself, nothing else — real AmCache data sparseness on this Windows build, not a read defect (confirmed: `get_or_empty` correctly returns `""` for a value that is genuinely absent from that subkey).
3. **ShimCache carries no execution-confirmation bit on Windows 10/11.** The AppCompatCache layout this plugin decodes ('win10' scheme, header DWORD 0x34/0x30) has no insert/execute flag field — `insert_flag` is therefore always the literal `-`, never a real per-entry value, on every capture this leg can produce.
4. **DEFAULT-OFF behind the server-side plugin-config kill switch.** None of the three actions dispatch until an operator explicitly `PUT`s `/api/v1/plugin-config/execution_artifacts/kill-switch {"enabled":true}` — on a fresh install or an unconfigured fleet, every dispatch attempt is refused at the server layer, not reported as a plugin-level failure.
5. **`amcache` reports `constrained|data_dir_unset` when `agent.data_dir` isn't configured, and `constrained|dest_dir_acl` on the rare chance its freshly-created per-dispatch scratch directory fails an owner/reparse-point safety check.** `agent.data_dir` is always set by the agent daemon in production (`agent.cpp`) — `data_dir_unset` should only ever fire outside that context (a test/tool harness that didn't configure it). The scratch directory itself is a 128-bit crypto-random name created fresh per dispatch and removed on completion — never reused, never a fixed path — so `dest_dir_acl` covers only the narrow window between that create and this leg re-opening it as a handle; no operator action is needed for either token beyond re-dispatching (a new scratch directory is created every time). A repeated `note|temp_cleanup_failed` line (e.g. an AV/EDR product holding `amcache.hve` open past this action's own lifetime) means a scratch directory was left behind instead — and a directory a killed or crashed agent process left behind (no destructor runs on a process kill) is reclaimed by a bounded sweep of `agent.data_dir` that runs at agent start and again immediately before each `amcache` dispatch: an `execution_artifacts-<32 hex>` directory whose last-write time is more than one hour old, that is a real directory (never a junction or symlink), that this process's token owner owns, and that contains only files is removed — handle-relative through the agent's confined-filesystem primitives, never by path, never recursing (`execution_artifacts_scratch_sweep_win.cpp`). Anything else of that name is left in place and counted. A directory younger than an hour is left alone (the age floor covers the moment between a concurrent dispatch creating its directory and opening the handle that then protects it), so an orphan is reclaimed at the first agent start or `amcache` dispatch at least one hour after it was left — not necessarily at the very next start. The sweep is capped per pass (entries enumerated, directories removed, wall time); what it could not reach waits for the next pass. Nothing today alerts on either accumulation if it keeps happening (a fleet-wide agent-metrics gap, not specific to this plugin: no Prometheus-style counter exists for `g_temp_cleanup_failed_total` or the sweep's own removed/failed counts, only their log lines and the `note|` row).
