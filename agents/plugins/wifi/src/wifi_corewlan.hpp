/**
 * wifi_corewlan.hpp — macOS current-Wi-Fi-connection query via CoreWLAN, plus
 * the pure `connected`-record formatter shared by the plugin and its unit test.
 *
 * CoreWLAN is an Objective-C framework, so `corewlan_current_connection()` is
 * implemented in the sibling Objective-C++ TU `wifi_corewlan.mm` (the first
 * `.mm` TU in the tree) and is only declared on Apple. The `WifiConnection`
 * struct and `format_connected_record()` are plain, platform-neutral C++ so the
 * output contract can be unit-tested on every CI leg without CoreWLAN or live
 * Wi-Fi hardware (tests/unit/test_wifi_corewlan.cpp).
 *
 * Replaces the dead `airport -I` shell-out: the private `airport` binary was
 * removed in macOS 14 (Sonoma), so the old path returned nothing and the agent
 * always reported "Not connected" even while associated.
 *
 * Location Services caveat (macOS 14+): `ssid` and `bssid` are gated behind
 * Location Services authorisation. A background LaunchDaemon has no practical
 * way to obtain it, so on modern macOS those two fields are typically withheld
 * (returned nil) even for a live association. Everything else — power state,
 * association, RSSI, channel, security, interface name — is returned without
 * authorisation, so we can honestly report a connection and mark SSID/BSSID as
 * withheld rather than falsely claiming "Not connected". See docs/darwin-compat.md.
