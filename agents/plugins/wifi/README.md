## How it works

`list_networks` scans for visible access points, one row per AP (SSID, signal, security, channel, BSSID/type). Windows walks every WLAN interface via `WlanEnumInterfaces` + `WlanGetAvailableNetworkList` (wifi_plugin.cpp:666-715). Linux first reads NetworkManager's cached `AccessPoints` over D-Bus — a read only, not a scan trigger; it requires a device to report a finished `LastScan` before trusting the cache — then falls to `nmcli device wifi list` (which does scan), then a per-interface `iwlist <iface> scan` bounded by a 45s aggregate ladder budget across the whole action (wifi_plugin.cpp:87-105, 716-869). macOS runs the legacy `airport -s` (removed in macOS 14+) and then `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType`, both via the bounded argv runner and both needing a Location Services grant a background daemon typically lacks (wifi_plugin.cpp:870-937).

`connected` reports the single currently-associated network. Windows walks every connected-state interface via `WlanQueryInterface`; Linux checks NetworkManager's `ActiveAccessPoint` over D-Bus, then nmcli's `ACTIVE` row, then an `iwconfig` ESSID/Signal text blob; macOS reads CoreWLAN directly — native, no shell-out (wifi_corewlan.mm:69-118).

Every subprocess leg is gated on `wifi_tool_answered()`: a tool only counts as having answered the question if it exited zero, so a spawn failure or nonzero exit is never reported as a fabricated "Not connected" or an empty scan (wifi_parsers.hpp:695-721). No leg anywhere invokes a shell or interpreter — every subprocess call is direct argv (wifi_plugin.cpp:16-24, wifi_parsers.hpp:630-637). It deliberately does not distinguish WEP from Open on the Linux D-Bus leg (the AP's PRIVACY bit is never read, wifi_parsers.hpp:592-595), and it does not itself trigger a NetworkManager scan on the D-Bus rung — it consumes whatever cache already exists.

## OS capability

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen capability -->
| Action | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| `connected` | ✅ supported · rung 1 · WlanQueryInterface | 🟡 constrained · rung 1 · CoreWLAN | 🟡 constrained · rung 1 · NetworkManager D-Bus (sd-bus) |

**Declared limits per leg** (descriptor fallback text, verbatim):

- **`connected` / macOS** — Location Services (macOS 14+) may withhold SSID/BSSID from a background daemon
- **`connected` / Linux** — reports the device interface (e.g. wlan0) in the connection column rather than the NetworkManager profile name; falls back to nmcli via the argv runner (rung 2), then an iwconfig ESSID/Signal blob. Not yet exercised against a real Wi-Fi radio
- **`list_networks` / macOS** — airport was removed in macOS 14 (Sonoma); the system_profiler SPAirPortDataType fallback needs Location Services authorisation a background daemon may lack, so an unauthorised modern host yields no networks and an honest wifi|info sentinel
- **`list_networks` / Linux** — reads NetworkManager's cached AccessPoints and does not itself initiate a scan (falls through to nmcli, which rescans, when NM reports no finished scan); then falls back to nmcli via the argv runner (rung 2), then an iw/iwlist text dump. Not yet exercised against a real Wi-Fi radio

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | None — `WlanGetAvailableNetworkList`/`WlanQueryInterface` need no elevation (docs/agent-privilege-model.md row 96) | 2026-09-07 on bare-metal as SYSTEM (windows.txt capture stamp) | A WLAN API failure (not privilege-specific) reports `UNAVAILABLE`/`PARTIAL` with a named provenance rather than a false "Not connected" (wifi_plugin.cpp:956-971, 1023-1027) |
| macOS | agent LaunchDaemon, root by default (no `UserName` key — docs/agent-privilege-model.md "macOS is the current exception"); this plugin itself needs no elevation | None for `connected` (CoreWLAN reads are unprivileged); `list_networks`' `system_profiler` fallback needs a Location Services grant a background daemon cannot obtain (docs/agent-privilege-model.md row 96) | 2026-09-07 on bare-metal at **euid 501 (alex)** — unprivileged, not the production root LaunchDaemon identity (macos.txt capture stamp) | `list_networks`: `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL`/`wifi:macos_scan_requires_location_services`, sentinel `wifi\|info\|...` (wifi_plugin.cpp:931-936). `connected`: SSID/BSSID silently become `<ssid-withheld>` on an otherwise-live connection, never a false "Not connected" (wifi_corewlan.hpp:14-22) |
| Linux | agent unprivileged account (`yuzu`, docs/agent-privilege-model.md "TL;DR") | None for the D-Bus read or the `nmcli` argv fallback; the tertiary `iwlist <iface> scan` needs root for an active scan, which the agent does not hold and does not request (docs/agent-privilege-model.md row 96) | 2026-09-06 in a container as **euid 0 (root)** (linux.txt capture stamp) | Under the least-privilege agent, `iwlist` returns nothing and the plugin reports the scan as failed (`wifi\|error\|Wi-Fi scan failed on every discovered interface...`, `UNAVAILABLE`/`PARTIAL`/`wifi:iwlist_scan_failed`, wifi_plugin.cpp:833-839) rather than an empty airspace |

Binaries/subprocesses/network: Linux spawns `nmcli`, `iw`, `iwlist`, `iwconfig` via the bounded argv runner (20s per call, 45s aggregate ladder budget, wifi_plugin.cpp:84-97) and opens a D-Bus session-bus connection to NetworkManager (IPC, not a subprocess). macOS spawns `airport` (legacy, absent on macOS 14+) and `system_profiler` via the same bounded runner. Windows spawns nothing — it links `wlanapi.dll` directly (meson.build:8). No leg on any OS makes a network call of its own; the D-Bus and WLAN API calls are all local IPC to the host's own network stack.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
Neither action takes parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited rows. `list_networks` emits zero or more `wifi|...` rows per scan, or a single `wifi|info|...` / `wifi|error|...` / `wifi|scan_output|...` sentinel row when the scan could not enumerate real access points; `connected` emits exactly one `connected|...` row. Every free-text field (SSID, security, BSSID, raw scan blobs) is escaped through `safe_output_field` at the single emission site in `wifi_plugin.cpp`, because `wifi` is not a key|value plugin server-side and an unescaped `|`/`\n` in an attacker-controlled SSID would shift columns or fabricate a row (wifi_plugin.cpp:75-79, wifi_corewlan.hpp:58-65). The fourth and fifth columns of `list_networks` are OVERLOADED across platforms (see the table below), and its `wifi|scan_output|<blob>` fallback — the raw `iwlist` text after ESSID/Quality/Encryption filtering — does not populate the declared columns at all; it is one opaque field (wifi_plugin.cpp:824-828).

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen outputs -->
**`device.wifi.connected` — `ssid|signal|security|bssid|interface_or_channel`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ssid` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `none` | The connected network's SSID; sentinel none/unknown when disconnected or undetermined; <ssid-withheld> on macOS when Location Services blocks the read on an otherwise-live association; <hex:...> on the Linux D-Bus leg for a non-UTF-8 SSID. Values: SSID text, none, unknown, <ssid-withheld>, or <hex:...>. |
| `signal` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `Not connected` | Signal strength using the same per-OS units as list_networks' signal field; on a disconnected/undetermined sentinel row this carries the free-text message instead (e.g. "Not connected"). Values: integer, or a free-text sentinel message. |
| `security` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `0` | Security type of the connected access point; "unknown" on the Linux iwconfig blob fallback; "0" on the disconnected/undetermined sentinel. Values: free text, unknown, or 0. |
| `bssid` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `none` | Connected access point's MAC address; - or none when not associated or unknown. Values: MAC address, -, or none. |
| `interface_or_channel` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `none` | Wireless interface name on Linux/Windows (e.g. wlan0, an adapter description); 802.11 channel number on macOS; none when undetermined. Values: interface name string, channel number, or none. |

**`device.wifi.list_networks` — `ssid|signal|security|channel_or_type|bssid_or_connected`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ssid` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `info` | The network's SSID, or a sentinel discriminator (info/error/ scan_output) when the row is a status line rather than an access point. Values: SSID text, <hidden> (empty SSID), <hex:...> (Linux D-Bus non-UTF-8 SSID), or info/error/scan_output. |
| `signal` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `wi-fi scan unavailable; airport removed in macOS 14+ and system_profiler requires Location Services` | Signal strength: 0-100 quality/percent on Windows and Linux, RSSI in dBm on macOS; on a sentinel row this field carries the free-text message instead. Values: integer 0-100 (Windows/Linux), a dBm integer (macOS), or free text on a sentinel row. |
| `security` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `0` | The access point's security type in the emitting leg's own vocabulary (e.g. Open, WPA2-Personal, WPA3, 802.1X); "0" on a sentinel row. Values: free text, or 0 on a sentinel row. |
| `channel_or_type` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `0` | 802.11 channel number on Linux/macOS; BSS type (Infrastructure/Ad-hoc/Unknown) on Windows -- the two OS families populate genuinely different data in this column. Values: channel number as a string, 0 when unknown, or Infrastructure/Ad-hoc/Unknown. |
| `bssid_or_connected` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `none` | Access point MAC address on Linux/macOS; the literal true/false for whether this network is the one currently connected on Windows -- again a different meaning per OS. Values: MAC address, - when unknown, or true/false. |

### Result status

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` | FULL | `wifi:nm_dbus_fallthrough` | Linux, both actions: NetworkManager D-Bus failed/unreachable and the action fell through to nmcli — provenance, not a failure, because the next rung answers fully (wifi_plugin.cpp:754-755, 1055-1056) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | PARTIAL | `wifi:action_budget_exhausted` | Linux `list_networks`: the 45s aggregate ladder budget ran out mid `iwlist` scan with interfaces still unscanned (wifi_plugin.cpp:806-808) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | PARTIAL | `wifi:macos_scan_requires_location_services` | macOS `list_networks`: neither `airport` nor `system_profiler` produced rows (wifi_plugin.cpp:931-933) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | PARTIAL | `wifi:iwlist_scan_failed` | Linux `list_networks`: interfaces were discovered but no `iwlist scan` answered (wifi_plugin.cpp:835-837) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | PARTIAL | `wifi:no_wireless_tools` | Linux `list_networks`: neither nmcli nor `iw` answered and no runner-level failure was already forwarded (wifi_plugin.cpp:857-859) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | PARTIAL | `wifi:wlan_open_handle_failed` / `wifi:wlan_enum_interfaces_failed` / `wifi:wlan_query_interface_failed` | Windows `connected`: the WLAN API call itself failed (wifi_plugin.cpp:956-957, 967-968, 1023-1025) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | PARTIAL | `wifi:nmcli_and_iwconfig_failed` | Linux `connected`: neither nmcli nor iwconfig answered and no runner-level failure was already forwarded (wifi_plugin.cpp:1111-1113) |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | PARTIAL | `subprocess_runner:spawn_error` | The child process could not be spawned at all — this is what the linux.txt sample shows for both actions (wifi_plugin.cpp:768-769, 822-823, 854-855, 1074-1075, 1090-1091, 1109-1110) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | PARTIAL | `subprocess_runner:deadline` | The runner's own deadline elapsed and the child was killed still running, forwarded via the same `forward_runner_failure` call sites |
| `CONSTRAINED` | PARTIAL | `subprocess_runner:cancelled` | The run was cancelled before it finished, forwarded via the same call sites |
| `CONSTRAINED` | PARTIAL | `subprocess_runner:signaled` | The child was killed by a signal rather than exiting cleanly, forwarded via the same call sites |
| `OK` | PARTIAL | `subprocess_runner:line_limit` | A deliberate bounded stop: the runner capped output at its line limit and killed a still-producing child — not a failure, but incomplete |

macOS `connected` and Windows `list_networks` never call `set_result_status` on any path (wifi_plugin.cpp:666-715, 1117-1134); Windows `connected`'s "not found, no error" branch (wifi_plugin.cpp:1028-1030) is the same. All three record `UNDECLARED`/`UNKNOWN` with empty provenance, exactly as the macos.txt and windows.txt samples show.

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result only.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response and land in the ResponseStore at the DSL default 90-day retention (`spec.response.retentionDays` is unset in `wifi.yaml`, docs/yaml-dsl-spec.md:190-194), queryable at `/api/responses/{id}`.
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync inventory, the TAR warehouse, DEX, or metrics. Nothing runs on a schedule — `gather.ttlSeconds: 30` bounds the agent's response deadline, not a recurring interval (docs/yaml-dsl-spec.md:184-188) — the plugin executes only when an operator or workflow dispatches one of its two definitions.
- **Sensitivity.** `bssid`/`bssid_or_connected` rows carry access-point MAC addresses (device identifiers, not the managed host's own) on Linux/macOS `list_networks` and on `connected` across all three OSes; `ssid` free text can itself identify a person or a specific device (e.g. a personal hotspot named after its owner, or the `<hex:...>` fallback for a non-UTF-8 SSID). No column carries the host's own hostname, IP address, or a logged-in username.
- **Siblings:** none of this plugin's own definitions feed TAR. TAR ships its own, independent `netconn` capture source (`agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_netconn.hpp`, Windows-only, opt-in, default-disabled) that records Wi-Fi connect/fail/disconnect transitions from the OS event log with a stricter allow-list than this plugin — it never extracts SSID, BSSID, or profile names (tar_schema_registry.cpp:838-844).
- **MCP / REST.** Discover: `discover_plugins` (summary) → `yuzu://plugin-docs` (this page as data) → `discover_instructions` / `get_definition("device.wifi.connected")`. Run: `execute_instruction {definition_id, parameters}`. Read: `/api/responses/{id}`.

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **Windows `list_networks` can emit zero rows with no sentinel.** A failed WLAN handle or zero enumerated interfaces IS reported (`wifi|error|Cannot open WLAN handle|...`, `wifi|error|No wireless interfaces found|...`, wifi_plugin.cpp:670-673, 677-682). The silent gap is one level deeper: once at least one interface exists, `WlanGetAvailableNetworkList` returning `ERROR_SUCCESS` with zero networks (wifi_plugin.cpp:689-691) leaves the per-network loop with nothing to iterate (wifi_plugin.cpp:693,710) — no sentinel is written, unlike the Linux/macOS legs, which always emit an explicit `wifi|info|...`/`wifi|error|...` line for an empty result. This is what the windows.txt capture shows: the-rig's SYSTEM capture had a wireless interface (the WLAN API needs no interactive session) but no visible networks.
2. **The Linux D-Bus rung has never met a real access point.** Every AP-property signature is spec/introspection-verified, not runtime-verified: the verification host was a container with no wireless device (wifi_plugin.cpp:159-166, 1184-1202). Promoting either leg to `SUPPORTED` needs one real-radio run that returns an AP through D-Bus and a second that forces the nmcli fallback (wifi_plugin.cpp:1199-1202).
3. **WEP is indistinguishable from Open on the Linux D-Bus leg.** `nm_security_flags_to_string` reads only `WpaFlags`/`RsnFlags`, never the AP's PRIVACY bit, so a WEP-only AP reports `Open` the same as a genuinely unsecured one (wifi_parsers.hpp:592-595).
4. **The nmcli `connected` fallback was dead on every host before this migration.** The previous `nmcli device show` argv requested `WIFI.SSID`/`WIFI.SIGNAL`-family fields that command rejects outright (`invalid field 'WIFI.SSID'`, exit 2); `device wifi list`'s `ACTIVE` row replaces it (wifi_parsers.hpp:140-155).
5. **Neither non-Windows sample exercises the least-privilege path.** The Linux capture ran as root (euid 0) in a container with no `nmcli`/`iw` installed at all, so both actions hit the "no wireless tools" branch rather than the documented root-only-`iwlist` degrade; the macOS capture ran unprivileged (euid 501), not as the production root LaunchDaemon (docs/agent-privilege-model.md "macOS is the current exception").
