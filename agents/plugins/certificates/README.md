## How it works

`list` and `details` enumerate certificates in the OS's own stores and emit the same eight-field row per certificate; `list` returns every match (filtered by `store` and `expiring_within_days`), `details` returns the one row whose thumbprint matches (case-insensitive) or a `status|not_found`. `delete` is destructive: it hex-validates the thumbprint, then removes the certificate from the named store. On macOS `delete` additionally pre-checks presence before ever running the destructive command (so deleting an absent cert reports `status|not_found` instead of a command failure) and re-enumerates the keychain afterward to prove the certificate is actually gone before reporting `status|deleted` — a zero exit code alone is not trusted.

Windows reads/writes CryptoAPI stores (MY, ROOT, CA, Trust) natively, in-process, no subprocess. Linux parses PEM files under `/etc/ssl/certs` via in-process libcrypto (`certificates_x509.hpp`) — the `openssl x509` subprocess this used to shell out to is gone. macOS is a genuine hybrid: System.keychain and SystemRootCertificates.keychain are read in-process via `SecItemCopyMatching`, but the login keychain (the console user's own keychain, which the LaunchDaemon has none of itself) still reads through a `launchctl asuser`/`sudo -u`/`security find-certificate` subprocess hop, and `delete` always shells out to `/usr/bin/security delete-certificate`. Every macOS action runs under a shared 60-second wall-clock budget covering console-user resolution and every keychain read/parse it performs, so a wedged Directory Service or a pathological keychain degrades honestly (a `not_available|<reason>` row plus a `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL` result status) instead of hanging or silently truncating.

This plugin deliberately does not validate a certificate's trust chain, check revocation (CRL/OCSP), import or renew certificates, or read anything beyond the fixed set of stores/keychains named above.

**Declared limits per leg** (descriptor fallback text, verbatim):

- **`delete` / macOS** — SystemRootCertificates.keychain is sealed under SIP and rejected outright; only System/MY store deletes are supported
- **`details` / macOS** — System.keychain and SystemRootCertificates.keychain are read natively via SecItemCopyMatching (rung 1); the login keychain still requires the launchctl/sudo session hop, run as a pre-split argv through the bounded subprocess runner
- **`list` / macOS** — System.keychain and SystemRootCertificates.keychain are read natively via SecItemCopyMatching (rung 1); the login keychain still requires the launchctl/sudo session hop, run as a pre-split argv through the bounded subprocess runner

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | `list`/`details`: none — `CertEnumCertificatesInStore` needs no elevation. `delete`: `SeBackupPrivilege` + `SeRestorePrivilege` to write the certificate store; already granted to the service account under LocalSystem today, no new grant. | 2026-09-07, bare-metal Windows 10.0.26200.0 x64, as SYSTEM | `enumerate_store()` silently returns an empty vector when the store handle can't be opened (`certificates_plugin.cpp:325-341`) — `list`/`details` emit no row and no sentinel for that store; `delete` reports `status\|not_found` if the store can't be opened (`certificates_plugin.cpp:406-409`) |
| macOS | agent daemon; the shipped LaunchDaemon has no `UserName` key, so it runs as root — but this sample was captured unprivileged (see Measured) | System/root keychain reads: none (in-process `SecItemCopyMatching`, no subprocess). Login keychain read: root, via `launchctl asuser` + `sudo -u` — live today only because the daemon runs as root; needs a dormant sudoers grant once #1455 narrows the agent off root. `delete` (System/MY only): a sudoers grant for `/usr/bin/security delete-certificate -t /Library/Keychains/System.keychain *` under the future non-root account; moot today. | 2026-09-07, bare-metal macOS 26.6.2 arm64, euid 501 (jsmith) — unprivileged, captured via the test harness (`PluginHandle::load` + `LocalDispatcher::run`, no `init()`), not the production root LaunchDaemon | System/root keychain failure emits `not_available\|<keychain> read failed` + `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL` (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1306,1333`); login-keychain failure emits `not_available\|login keychain read failed` + `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL` (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1394-1396`) — the macOS sample shows exactly this (`macos.txt:164-165`) |
| Linux | dedicated unprivileged `yuzu` account in production; this sample was captured as euid 0 in a container, not representative of that account | `list`/`details`: none — native filesystem read + in-process libcrypto parse, no subprocess. `delete`: write access to `/etc/ssl/certs` to remove the matching file (`std::filesystem::remove`, `certificates_plugin.cpp:635`). | 2026-09-06, Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) aarch64 container, euid 0 | An unreadable/unparseable PEM file reports `(unreadable)`/`(skipped)` and `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL` rather than being silently dropped (`certificates_plugin.cpp:479-520`); `details`/`delete` report `not_available\|... scan incomplete` / `error\|...` rather than a false `not_found` when a candidate file couldn't be inspected (`certificates_plugin.cpp:592-596,643-649`) |

Binaries/subprocesses/network: Windows — none, in-process CryptoAPI/`crypt32` only. macOS — `/usr/bin/openssl` (per-block PEM parse, `certificates_plugin.cpp:989-992`), `/usr/bin/security` (`find-certificate`/`delete-certificate`, `certificates_plugin.cpp:1709,1850`), `/usr/bin/stat` (console-user resolution, `certificates_plugin.cpp:1117`) — all via the bounded subprocess runner, pre-split argv, no shell. Linux — none, in-process libcrypto only (`certificates_plugin.cpp:83-88`). No network access on any OS.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
| Definition | Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `security.certificates.delete` | `thumbprint` | string | yes | - | - | SHA-1 thumbprint (hex string, no colons) of the certificate to delete. Case-insensitive. |
| `security.certificates.delete` | `store` | string | no | MY | - | The certificate store to delete from. On Windows: MY, ROOT, CA, or Trust. Defaults to "MY". On macOS: "MY" (the default) or "System" deletes from /Library/Keychains/System.keychain, matching prior behaviour. "root" is REJECTED (non-zero exit, unsupported) -- SystemRootCertificates.keychain is sealed by System Integrity Protection on modern macOS and cannot actually be modified, so attempting it would report a change that never took effect. "login" and "all" are also not supported for delete and are rejected with an error rather than silently deleting from an unintended store, as is any other unrecognized value. Ignored on Linux. |
| `security.certificates.details` | `thumbprint` | string | yes | - | - | SHA-1 thumbprint (hex string, no colons) of the certificate to retrieve. Case-insensitive. |
| `security.certificates.details` | `store` | string | no | all | - | On macOS, restrict the search to one store: "login" (the current console user's login keychain -- returns not_available\|no console session when nobody is logged in at the console, or not_available\|<reason> when the console user could not be determined; in the latter case the search result is PARTIAL and never a definitive status\|not_found, because the login keychain was not opened), "System" (/Library/Keychains/System.keychain), "root" (SystemRootCertificates.keychain), or "all" (System and root, plus login when a console user is present). Ignored on Windows and Linux, which always search every store. Defaults to "all". |
| `security.certificates.list` | `store` | string | no | all | - | Filter by store name. On Windows: MY, ROOT, CA, Trust, or "all" for all stores. On macOS: "login" (the current console user's login keychain -- returns not_available\|no console session when nobody is logged in at the console, or not_available\|<reason> when the console user could not be determined, e.g. the directory lookup timed out; the two are deliberately distinct, a degraded lookup is never reported as an empty console), "System" (/Library/Keychains/System.keychain), "root" (SystemRootCertificates.keychain), or "all" (System and root, plus login when a console user is present). Ignored on Linux, which always enumerates every available certificate. Defaults to "all". |
| `security.certificates.list` | `expiring_within_days` | int32 | no | 0 | minimum 0 | Only return certificates expiring within this many days. Set to 0 to return all certificates regardless of expiry. Useful for compliance audits of soon-to-expire certificates. |

### Outputs

`list` and `details` write a header row followed by zero or more pipe-delimited certificate rows, or a `status|not_found` / `not_available|<reason>` line in place of a row when nothing matched or a store couldn't be read. `delete` writes one line only: `status|<value>`, `error|<message>`, or (macOS only) `not_available|<reason>`. `(unknown)` is the honest per-field sentinel for a value that failed to parse — it never means zero or empty; `subject`/`issuer`/`serial`/`key_usage` are escaped so a hostile value can never inject an extra pipe-delimited column or newline-delimited row.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen outputs -->
**`security.certificates.delete` — `status`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `error\|thumbprint parameter required` | A successful macOS delete emits status\|deleted; a delete targeting a certificate already provably absent from the keychain emits status\|not_found (rc 0), matching the Windows/Linux contract for an absent cert. store=root is rejected with error\|MESSAGE (SystemRootCertificates.keychain is sealed by System Integrity Protection). Every other macOS rejection or failure -- an unsupported store, a failed delete command, or a post-delete verification that still finds the certificate or could not re-read the keychain -- also emits error\|MESSAGE. Windows and Linux always emit status\|deleted, status\|delete_failed, or status\|not_found. Values: status\|deleted, status\|not_found, status\|delete_failed (Windows/Linux only), error\|<message> (any OS: bad thumbprint, unsupported/rejected store, or a macOS delete that could not be verified), not_available\|<reason> (macOS only, pre-validation). |

**`security.certificates.details` — `subject|issuer|thumbprint|not_before|not_after|serial|store|key_usage`**

Values: free text (distinguished name). |
| `issuer` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `DigiCert Trusted G4 Code Signing RSA4096 SHA384 2021 CA1` | The certificate's Issuer distinguished name, rendered the same way as subject. Values: free text (distinguished name). |
| `thumbprint` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `FBD3B2C0991549EC5FB12FA1A994D2E0C32D8057` | SHA-1 fingerprint of the certificate's DER encoding, uppercase hex with no separators -- the identifier `details`/`delete` match against (the request parameter is case-insensitive, this column is always uppercase).

### Result status

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `libcrypto:unreadable-file` | Linux: a PEM file under `/etc/ssl/certs` could not be read or parsed (`certificates_plugin.cpp:512,630`) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `login-keychain` | macOS: console-user resolution or the login-keychain read/scan failed, degraded, or was capped (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1268,1358-1396`) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `secitem:System.keychain` | macOS: System.keychain read or scan failed or was capped (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1291,1303,1307`) |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `secitem:SystemRootCertificates.keychain` | macOS: SystemRootCertificates.keychain read or scan failed or was capped (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1317,1330,1334`) |

Windows never calls `set_result_status`; a clean Windows run, and any run that hits none of the degradations above, leaves the agent's default `UNDECLARED`/`UNKNOWN` status — the sample captures show this (`windows.txt:84,89,93`; `linux.txt:155,160,164`; `macos.txt:170,174`).

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result only.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response and land in the ResponseStore (90-day default retention, `server/core/src/response_store.hpp:8,152`), queryable at `/api/responses/{id}` and aggregatable (`list` groups by `store`/`issuer` per its YAML `aggregation` block).
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync inventory, the TAR warehouse, DEX, or metrics — no reference to the `certificates` plugin or its definition ids exists outside `server/core/src/capability_decls/plugin_action_catalogue_c.hpp`.
- **Sensitivity.** `list`/`details` rows carry every certificate's `subject` and `issuer` — for code-signing certs (the Windows sample) this is effectively an installed-software-publisher inventory (e.g. `Logitech Inc`, `Microsoft Corporation`) by another route, and on macOS a successful login-keychain read can surface the signed-in user's own personal certificates; `thumbprint`/`serial` uniquely identify a specific certificate but not a device or person directly.
- **Siblings:** none in this plugin group; the `diagnostics.certificates` action (a different plugin, TLS cert/key diagnostics) is unrelated despite the similar name.
- **MCP / REST.** Discover: `discover_plugins` (summary) → `yuzu://plugin-docs` (this page as data) → `discover_instructions` / `get_definition("security.certificates.list")`. Run: `execute_instruction {definition_id, parameters}`. Read: `/api/responses/{id}`.

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **Windows store-open failures are silent.** `enumerate_store()` returns an empty vector when neither the LOCAL_MACHINE nor CURRENT_USER handle opens (`certificates_plugin.cpp:325-341`), and the Windows leg never calls `set_result_status` — a permission or missing-store failure looks identical to "this store is empty," unlike the explicit `not_available`/`CONSTRAINED` sentinels the macOS and Linux legs use.
2. **The login keychain read is a registered exception, not a rung-1 promotion.** System.keychain/SystemRootCertificates.keychain are read in-process via `SecItemCopyMatching`; the login keychain stays on the `launchctl asuser` + `sudo -u` + `security find-certificate` subprocess (rung 2, #3406) because the LaunchDaemon has no login keychain of its own (`certificates_plugin.cpp:16-23,750-762`) — do not "fix" this to a direct API call.
3. **SystemRootCertificates.keychain delete is permanently rejected.** It is sealed under System Integrity Protection; `delete_cert_macos` rejects `store=root` outright before ever shelling out (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1761-1771`) — a hard OS limitation, not a bug to fix.
4. **A macOS delete self-verifies before reporting success.** `delete_cert_macos` re-enumerates the target keychain after `security delete-certificate` exits 0 and only reports `status|deleted` on a positively-proven absence; a keychain that can't be re-read or still shows the certificate reports `error|...`, never a false `status|deleted` (`certificates_plugin.cpp:1863-1900`).
5. **The macOS sample was captured unprivileged and shows the login-keychain leg degrading live.** At euid 501 with no console session reachable via `launchctl asuser` without root, `list`'s login-keychain read failed and the result carries `CONSTRAINED`/`PARTIAL`/`login-keychain` (`macos.txt:164-165`) — expected under the capture harness, but it means this sample never exercises a successful login-keychain read.
