/**
 * disk_actions_macos.cpp — macOS leg entry points.
 *
 * MECHANISM, bound by spike on 2026-09-03 against this host's real hardware
 * (Apple Silicon, APPLE SSD AP0512Z): IOKit `IOBlockStorageDevice` matching,
 * reading `kIOPropertyDeviceCharacteristicsKey` for identity and the
 * `NVMe SMART Capable` property for capability. Rung 1, no subprocess, and it
 * works UNPRIVILEGED (measured at euid 501).
 *
 * WHY HEALTH IS NOT REPORTED HERE, and why that is CONSTRAINED rather than a
 * gap to be quietly filled later. The wear, available-spare and
 * critical-warning attributes live behind Apple's `IONVMeSMARTUserClient`,
 * whose selector interface is PRIVATE and undocumented. The spike confirmed
 * `IOServiceOpen` on the block device succeeds unprivileged (kr=0) and that a
 * selector exists (one returns kIOReturnNotPrivileged, others
 * kIOReturnBadArgument) -- so the door is there, but reaching the data means
 * reverse-engineering a call convention that Apple may change in any release.
 * ALEX RULING: not adopted. Building a shipped capability on an undocumented
 * interface is the same class of dependency as the dead
 * FSCTL_SRV_ENUMERATE_SNAPSHOTS this plugin's sibling had to be rescued from.
 * Health therefore reports `unknown` -- which is a true statement about what
 * this leg read -- and never `ok`, which would be a guess.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP. Every CF and IOKit object goes through ScopedCFRef / ScopedIOObject.
 * Note the documented trap those wrappers carry: ScopedIOObject must NOT wrap an
 * io_connect_t from IOServiceOpen (that needs IOServiceClose, and
 * IOObjectRelease leaves the user client instantiated in the kernel). This file
 * opens no user client at all, so the trap is not reachable here -- stated so a
 * future edit that adds one does not rediscover it.
