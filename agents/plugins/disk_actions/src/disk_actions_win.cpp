/**
 * disk_actions_win.cpp — Windows leg entry points.
 *
 * MECHANISMS, every one bound by spike against real hardware on 2026-09-03
 * (the-rig, live Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus over NVMe) before a line of this was
 * written. The full record is at ~/.claude/roadmaps/wave6-smart-spike.md.
 *
 *   smart    IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY with StorageDeviceProperty (identity,
 *            bus type), StorageDeviceSeekPenaltyProperty (SSD vs HDD) and
 *            StorageDeviceProtocolSpecificProperty + ProtocolTypeNvme +
 *            NVMeDataTypeLogPage page 0x02 (the SMART/Health log).
 *   volumes  FindFirstVolumeW/FindNextVolumeW +
 *            IOCTL_VOLUME_GET_VOLUME_DISK_EXTENTS (which physical drives back
 *            this volume) + GetVolumePathNamesForVolumeNameW (which mount
 *            points it serves).
 *
 * HOST-VERIFIED 2026-09-04 on that same host: this TU compiles under real MSVC
 * with zero errors, the agent suite passes there (76,268 assertions / 2,553
 * cases), and both actions were exercised against two live NVMe drives,
 * emitting distinct per-device wear figures rather than a constant:
 *
 *   smart|PhysicalDrive0|Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 250GB|nvme|ssd|ok|5|100|-
 *   smart|PhysicalDrive1|Samsung SSD 970 EVO Plus 1TB|nvme|ssd|ok|1|100|-
 *   volume|...{c9a5f911}/|C:/|PhysicalDrive0|-|248158093312|-
 *   volume|...{785383ef}/|D:/|PhysicalDrive1|-|1000187363328|-
 *
 * The last two lines are the join this plugin exists for: C: resolves to
 * PhysicalDrive0 and D: to PhysicalDrive1, so a failing drive can be named in
 * terms of the drive letters it serves.
 *
 * TWO SPIKE NEGATIVES, both load-bearing, both the kind of mistake that ships
 * a leg which silently never works:
 *
 *   1. THE DEVICE HANDLE IS OPENED WITH ZERO ACCESS RIGHTS, deliberately, and
 *      this is not a typo for GENERIC_READ. Measured: as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL
 *      SERVICE, CreateFileW with GENERIC_READ fails ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED, while
 *      a 0-access handle succeeds and serves BOTH IOCTLs (they are
 *      FILE_ANY_ACCESS controls). That single detail is why this leg keeps
 *      working when #1442 moves the agent off LocalSystem — unlike the VSS
 *      snapshots leg in filesystem_posture, which genuinely requires admin.
 *      Do not "fix" this to GENERIC_READ.
 *
 *   2. IOCTL_STORAGE_PREDICT_FAILURE — the obvious "documented health bit" —
 *      FAILS with ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION (1) on NVMe. It is the ATA-era API.
 *      This file does not use it, and a future edit that reaches for it should
 *      re-measure first rather than assume the docs describe modern drives.
 *
 * Every OS call here is read-only: no write, format or delete right is ever
 * requested on a drive or volume handle.
 *
 * BOUNDING, and an honest statement of what is NOT bounded. Every
 * DeviceIoControl below is synchronous on a handle opened without
 * FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, and there is no deadline on any of them. A wedged
 * device -- a failing USB drive, a disconnected SAN LUN, a removable in a
 * not-ready state -- therefore parks the dispatch-pool worker that called us,
 * and enough of them would exhaust the pool. Two things bound the ordinary
 * case: the probe stops at kMaxPhysicalDrives, and ThreadErrorModeGuard
 * suppresses the session-0 hard-error dialog that would otherwise block on a
 * not-ready volume. Neither bounds a driver that never returns.
 *
 * This is a PLATFORM GAP, not an omission here: agents/shared/bounded_wait.hpp
 * bounds waits on futures and processes, and there is no in-tree precedent for
 * bounding an ioctl/DeviceIoControl/IOKit call. Inventing a one-off here --
 * abandoning a detached thread mid-ioctl on a device handle -- is materially
 * riskier than the wedge it would paper over. Filed rather than improvised.
