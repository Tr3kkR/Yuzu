/**
 * disk_actions_parsers.hpp — the PURE decision layer for disk_actions.
 *
 * Everything here is a free function over plain data: no OS calls, no I/O, no
 * logging, no platform headers. That is the repo's standing test-efficiency
 * discipline (testable logic — parsing, decisions, formatting — lives in a
 * pure `*_parsers.hpp`; the OS interaction lives in a shell the unit suites
 * never run), and it is the sibling shape `filesystem_posture_parsers.hpp`
 * already establishes.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The first revision of this plugin had the NVMe
 * log decode and the health classification buried in an anonymous namespace
 * inside `disk_actions_win.cpp` — a `#if defined(_WIN32)` TU. Nothing could
 * reach them: no test on any platform could assert that byte offset 5 is
 * "percentage used", or that critical-warning bit 0 means a failing drive.
 * Both external functional reviewers independently reported that the whole
 * Windows health path had no discriminating test and would stay green if the
 * offsets or the bitmask meaning silently changed. They were right, and the
 * fix is structural rather than another assertion bolted onto a shape test:
 * the decisions move HERE, where every platform's unit suite can exercise them
 * against fixtures.

// ── degradation summary: the PURE precedence decision ───────────────────
//
// WHY THIS IS HERE. `set_result_status` ASSIGNS, so the LAST call wins, and
// the legs therefore report their degradations least-material first. That
// ordering is a real contract — reorder the `if` blocks and an operator sees a
// different cause for the same run — but it lived as a hand-ordered sequence of
// `if`s inside platform-guarded TUs that no unit suite loads. Governance found
// every one of those paths unproven, and both the quality and safety reviewers
// independently prescribed the same remedy: make the DECISION pure and leave
// only flag-setting in the shell.
//
// The legs fill a `DegradationFlags` and call `summarise_degradation`, then map
// the single winning kind to their own provenance token. The precedence lives
// here, where every platform's suite can exercise it — and NOWHERE ELSE. An
// earlier revision shipped this header alongside legs that still hand-ordered
// their own `if` chains: the tests passed, the precedence was untested in
// production, and the two orderings had already drifted apart (the macOS
// volumes leg had inverted its own, so its weakest cause won). Three governance
// agents caught it independently. If you add a cause, add it HERE.

/// Which degradations a leg observed. The order of the FIELDS is not
/// meaningful — `summarise_degradation` owns precedence, and it is the only
/// place that does.
