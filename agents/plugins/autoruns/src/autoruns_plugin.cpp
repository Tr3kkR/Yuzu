/**
 * autoruns_plugin.cpp — persistence-source enumeration ("what starts
 * automatically") across Windows, Linux and macOS.
 *
 * Actions:
 *   "catalog" — lists every SourceId this plugin knows about (the full
 *               34-source catalog, every OS), with the DECLARED support level
 *               this BUILD carries for it. No OS call: a pure reflection of
 *               autoruns_catalog.hpp.
 *   "list"    — runs every per-OS leg (collect_windows / collect_linux /
 *               collect_macos, autoruns_legs.hpp) and emits a `source|`
 *               status line per source plus zero or more `autorun|` rows for
 *               each source that produced data. `sources=` filters to a
 *               comma-separated SourceId allow-list; leg-internal.
 *
 * This TU is fully portable -- no target-OS #if of any kind. All three legs
 * are declared unconditionally so a single-OS build always links (see
 * autoruns_legs.hpp's foreign-OS stub) and the capability matrix generator
 * (#2204) sees a complete, stable three-OS shape regardless of which OS
 * built this plugin.
 *
 * Read-only: no action here mutates host state, spawns a process, or writes
 * to the registry/filesystem/launchd.
