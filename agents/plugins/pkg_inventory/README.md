## How it works

`managers` reports which package managers are present on the host and their manager-level configuration facts; `packages` lists the macOS Homebrew formulae and casks. Both are pure filesystem reads (`open`/`openat`/`readdir` with `O_NOFOLLOW` on every hop, so a symlinked prefix or marker is refused, never followed): no `brew`, `dpkg`, `rpm`, `pacman`, `apk` or `winget` is ever spawned. Every action writes a `status` row first, then data rows. On macOS, both actions probe both Homebrew prefixes (`/opt/homebrew` on Apple silicon, `/usr/local` on Intel) and read directory names under `Library/Taps`, `Cellar` and `Caskroom`. Machine scope only: per-user package stores are out of scope, deferred to the user-context bridge. On Linux, `managers` reads nothing and reports `status|managers|unsupported|linux:planned` (caveat 3), and `packages` is unsupported by design (`installed_apps` owns the Linux package roster). On Windows both actions read nothing and report `status|<action>|unsupported|windows:planned` (caveat 5). Every walk takes an injected root (production passes `/`) so the unit suite drives it over a committed fixture tree and through the real emission seam.

**Declared limits per leg** (descriptor fallback text, verbatim):

- **`managers` / Linux** — follows as its own PR
- **`packages` / Linux** — installed_apps.get_inventory_linux owns the Linux package roster
<!-- END GENERATED -->

The capability-matrix rows for this plugin in `docs/os-capability-matrix.md` are rendered from the plugin's own `kActionDescriptors` (`pkg_inventory_plugin.cpp`); the Windows legs and the Linux `managers` leg are declared `planned`, not `supported`.

## Privileges and prerequisites

| OS | Runs as | Extra grant needed | Measured | If the read is refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Windows | agent service account (LocalSystem today, #1442) | None — the leg reads nothing | Not measured — the leg emits only a status row (caveat 5) | n/a — no read is attempted; every action reports `status\|<action>\|unsupported\|windows:planned` |
| macOS | agent daemon, root today (LaunchDaemon carries no `UserName` key — `docs/agent-privilege-model.md` TL;DR); this plugin's own reads need no elevation beyond that default | None documented — Homebrew's `Cellar`, `Caskroom` and `Library/Taps` are ordinary directories | Not yet measured under the agent identity; the walk was exercised over a real formulae-only capture of this Mac's `/opt/homebrew/Cellar` (`tests/unit/fixtures/wave10/pkg_inventory/macos/provenance.txt`) | A location that exists but cannot be opened or listed makes the status row `constrained` with `macos:<source>:permission_denied` (or another detail token); a missing prefix is zero rows and `supported`, never a failure |
| Linux | agent daemon, default | None — the leg reads nothing | Not measured — the leg emits only a status row for either action (caveat 3) | n/a — no read is attempted; `managers` reports `status\|managers\|unsupported\|linux:planned` and `packages` reports `status\|packages\|unsupported\|linux:owned_by_installed_apps` |

Binaries/subprocesses: none — every read is an in-process filesystem read. Network: none.

## Data contract

### Inputs

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen inputs -->
Neither action takes parameters.
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Outputs

Pipe-delimited rows written via `write_output()`, two shapes per stream discriminated by field 0: exactly one `status|<action>|<supported\|constrained\|unsupported>|<failure tokens or ->` row first, then zero or more data rows — `manager|<name>|<present\|unavailable>|<version or ->|<root_path or ->|<facts k=v;... or ->|<reason or ->` for `managers`, `package|homebrew|<id>|<version>|<formula\|cask>` for `packages`. A genuinely absent manager or prefix is `supported` with zero data rows; an unreadable location is `constrained` with a token, never an empty success. `root_path` is the logical path (`/opt/homebrew`, `/usr/local`), never an injected test root; a manager row's `version` is always `-` in this release (no `brew --version` is run), while a package row's `version` is the real version directory name. A formula or cask present under both prefixes yields one `package|` row per prefix; the package row carries no prefix column — the manager rows say which prefixes exist. Every OS-supplied field goes through the shared escaper `yuzu::util::safe_output_field`, so a pipe or trailing backslash in a directory name cannot shift a column. This plugin is not in the server's `kKeyValuePlugins` set, so the server does not decode its rows as two-cell `key|rest`; the columns below are the definition's own.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: plugin-doc-gen outputs -->
**`crossplatform.software.package_manager_packages` — `row_kind|manager|id|version|kind`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `row_kind` | string | `status` `package` | Windows, Linux, macOS | `package` | Row shape discriminator. Values: status (exactly one per result, always first), package (one per installed formula or cask version directory). |
| `manager` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `homebrew` | Package rows: the owning package manager, always homebrew in this release. Status rows: the action name, always packages. |
| `id` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `openssl@3` | Package rows: the formula or cask directory name (e.g. openssl@3). Status rows: the completeness level. Values: supported, constrained (at least one read failed or the row cap or walk budget was hit), unsupported (Linux by design, Windows planned). |
| `version` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `3.4.1` | Package rows: the version directory name under the formula or cask (cask versions may carry commas or colons). Status rows: the comma-joined failure tokens, or "-" when none. Tokens read <os>:<source>:<detail> (e.g. macos:homebrew_cellar:row_cap or macos:homebrew_caskroom:walk_budget), linux:owned_by_installed_apps or windows:planned. |
| `kind` | string | `formula` `cask` | macOS | `formula` | Package rows only: whether the directory came from the Cellar or the Caskroom. Values: formula, cask. |

**`crossplatform.software.package_managers` — `row_kind|name|state|version|root_path|facts|reason`**

| Field | Type | Values | Available | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `row_kind` | string | `status` `manager` | Windows, Linux, macOS | `manager` | Row shape discriminator. Values: status (exactly one per result, always first), manager (one per package manager detected). |
| `name` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `homebrew` | Manager rows: the package manager. Values: dpkg, apt, rpm, dnf, pacman, apk, homebrew. Only homebrew is emitted in this release: Linux managers leg planned; on Linux the status row reports unsupported\|linux:planned and there are no manager rows. Status rows: the action name, always managers. |
| `state` | string | `present` `unavailable` `supported` `constrained` `unsupported` | Windows, Linux, macOS | `present` | Manager rows: present means at least one Homebrew marker directory (Library/Taps, Cellar, Caskroom) under the prefix was readable; unavailable means a marker exists but none could be read (see reason). Status rows: the completeness level. Values: supported, constrained (at least one read failed), unsupported (Windows and Linux planned legs). |
| `version` | string | - | Windows, Linux, macOS | `-` | Manager rows: the manager version, or "-" (versions are not read in this release, so always "-"). Status rows: the comma-joined failure tokens, or "-" when none. Tokens read <os>:<source>:<detail> (e.g. macos:homebrew_cellar:permission_denied or macos:homebrew_taps:walk_budget), linux:planned or windows:planned. |
| `root_path` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `/opt/homebrew` | Manager rows only: the logical root the facts were read from (e.g. /opt/homebrew, /usr/local; /etc/apt once the Linux managers leg lands), never an injected test root; "-" when the manager has no single root (Linux rpm). |
| `facts` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `taps=0;formulae=66;casks=0` | Manager rows only: semicolon-separated key=value manager-level facts, or "-". Keys by manager: dpkg architectures=<a,b>; apt sources_list_lines, sources_d_files; dnf repo_files, dnf_conf_lines; pacman pacman_conf_lines, mirrors; apk repositories, tagged, arch; homebrew taps, formulae, casks. A key is omitted when its source could not be read. Only the homebrew keys are emitted in this release (Linux managers leg planned). |
| `reason` | string | - | Linux, macOS | `-` | Manager rows only: failure tokens for an unavailable manager, or "-". |
<!-- END GENERATED -->

### Result status

| Status | Completeness | Provenance | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OK` | `FULL` | — | The read completed: managers or packages were found, or none were (an absent manager or prefix is a complete answer, not a degradation). |
| `CONSTRAINED` | `PARTIAL` | `<os>:<source>:<detail>` | At least one location could not be read completely. `<os>` is `macos`; `<source>` names the location (`homebrew_taps`, `homebrew_cellar`, `homebrew_caskroom`); `<detail>` is `permission_denied`, `symlink_refused`, `not_a_directory`, `io_error`, `entry_cap` or `enumeration_error` (directory listing truncated or errored), `row_cap` (Homebrew package-row cap reached) or `walk_budget` (the whole-action entry or wall-clock budget ran out; the locations not yet read are skipped and the rows already found are kept). A symlinked Homebrew prefix or marker directory is refused, never followed (`symlink_refused` or `not_a_directory`, by platform). Several tokens are comma-joined. |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | `PARTIAL` | `linux:owned_by_installed_apps` | Linux `packages`: unsupported by design; `installed_apps` owns the Linux package roster. |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | `PARTIAL` | `linux:planned` | Linux `managers`: the leg reads nothing and emits only `status\|managers\|unsupported\|linux:planned` (caveat 3). |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | `PARTIAL` | `windows:planned` | Windows, either action: the leg reads nothing and emits only `status\|<action>\|unsupported\|windows:planned` (caveat 5). |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | `PARTIAL` | `pkg_inventory:exception` | Either action, either OS: a leg threw during a read; `execute()` catches it, reports this fixed token, and never lets the exception cross the plugin ABI. |

### Where the data goes

- **Instruction result.** Rows travel over the agent's mTLS gRPC channel as the command response and land in the ResponseStore, queryable at `/api/responses/{id}`. Both actions are gathered definitions (`crossplatform.software.package_managers` and `crossplatform.software.package_manager_packages`, 300s TTL).
- **Not consumed by** daily-sync, TAR, DEX, or metrics.
- **Sensitivity.** Rows name installed software (Homebrew formula and cask names and versions) and the Homebrew prefixes present on the host with their tap, formula and cask counts — a software inventory by another route. No row carries a username, account name or user-profile path.
- **Siblings:** `installed_apps` (owns the Linux package roster and the macOS application list, and its `list_per_user` also lists Homebrew formulae per user — see caveat 4 for both overlaps) and `software_actions` (installs and removes software; this plugin only reads).

## Caveats and known gaps

1. **No documented business driver.** The roadmap verification of 2026-09-19 found zero documented business driver anywhere in the four planning docs for this plugin; it ships as a read-only inventory fact source, not a response to a stated customer requirement.
2. **Machine scope only.** Machine scope only: per-user package stores are out of scope, deferred to the user-context bridge. Per-user Homebrew, npm global-versus-user, pip user installs and cargo are not read.
3. **Linux is identity and config only, and `managers` follows as its own PR.** The Linux leg will report which package managers are present and their configuration facts, never a package roster: installed_apps owns the roster, so Linux `packages` is unsupported by design and never emits a `package|` row. Until the Linux `managers` leg lands it reports `status|managers|unsupported|linux:planned` and no manager rows.
4. **Homebrew rows overlap `installed_apps` on macOS, and cask and tap rows are unexercised against real data.** Homebrew casks install `.app` bundles that `installed_apps`' macOS `list` also reports via `system_profiler`, and `installed_apps`' `list_per_user` already lists Homebrew formulae per user as `user_app|brew|<name>|<version>|-|-` (it runs `brew list --versions`); this plugin is the machine-scope, zero-subprocess view of the same store (manager identity, prefixes, cask versions) and does not claim to be disjoint from either. The real-capture host had a populated `Cellar` only (no `Library/Taps`, empty `Caskroom`, no `/usr/local` Homebrew), so tap and cask counting and the Intel prefix are covered only by synthetic in-code layouts that encode the layout the walk assumes, not by a real capture.
5. **Windows and Linux `managers` legs planned — each follows as its own PR.** Both Windows actions report `status|<action>|unsupported|windows:planned` and no data rows, and Linux `managers` reports `status|managers|unsupported|linux:planned` and no data rows. The Chocolatey `lib\` directory walk with `.nuspec` metadata, winget presence and the Linux manager identity and config walk follow as their own PRs; nothing for them is built here.
