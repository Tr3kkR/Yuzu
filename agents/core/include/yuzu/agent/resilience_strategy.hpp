/**
 * resilience_strategy.hpp — per-rule enforcement retry policy for Guardian guards
 * (design docs/yuzu-guardian-design-v1.1.md §8.5).
 *
 * Pure, platform-independent decision logic with an INJECTED clock, so the three
 * modes are unit-testable deterministically on any OS without sleeps. A guard
 * consults decide() before each enforce remediation (a value write OR a key
 * recreate). The strategy gates ONLY the remediation — detection and event
 * emission always happen regardless of what decide() returns, so a backed-off or
 * given-up guard still reports drift.
 *
 *   Persist  — remediate immediately on every drift; sub-ms; never give up (default).
 *   Backoff  — exponential delay between re-enforcements (initial × 2ⁿ, capped);
 *              never gives up. Trades latency for calm against a noisy adversary.
 *   Bounded  — give up after N consecutive re-fix cycles in one fight; a quiet
 *              window resets the counter; on give-up stop fixing (keep detecting)
 *              and stay given-up until an admin re-pushes — unless `resume_after`
 *              schedules an automatic retry.
 *
 * Modes apply in ENFORCE mode only; an audit guard never calls decide().
