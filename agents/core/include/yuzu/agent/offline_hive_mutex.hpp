/**
 * offline_hive_mutex.hpp -- process-wide serialization for the Windows
 * per-user registry-hive offline-mount path (#2771 code-review CFX-1).
 *
 * agents/shared/win_profiles.hpp's with_user_hive() enables
 * SeBackupPrivilege/SeRestorePrivilege on the PROCESS token before an offline
 * RegLoadKeyW mount and restores the token's prior attributes on the way out.
 * Four plugins load this ladder into the SAME agent process --
 * registry, installed_apps, license_scan, tar -- and tar's collectors run on
 * a background thread, so two overlapping offline-mount attempts race the
 * shared process token: A enables it, B enables it (recording A's now-enabled
 * state as "previous"), A's scope exits and restores to B's recorded
 * "previous" -- silently disabling it out from under B, mid-mount.
 *
 * A std::mutex defined as a plain `inline`/header-local static in
 * win_profiles.hpp does NOT solve this: each of the four plugin .dll/.so
 * files is a SEPARATE dynamically loaded module, and a function-local static
 * in a header is instantiated once PER TRANSLATION UNIT THAT LINKS IT IN --
 * in practice, once per plugin binary. Four plugins therefore got four
 * independent mutexes, not one process-wide lock (confirmed: each plugin DLL
 * exports exactly its one required `yuzu_plugin_descriptor` symbol and
 * nothing else -- the mutex was never shared).
 *
 * The fix is the one this codebase already uses for the identical problem --
 * see fork_lock.hpp's global_fork_lock(): define the mutex ONCE in
 * agents/core (compiled into the single yuzu_agent_core shared library every
 * plugin links against) and export it via YUZU_EXPORT, so every plugin's
 * import resolves to the SAME address in the SAME already-loaded module.
 *
 * Scope: covers the whole offline arm (privilege enable -> RegLoadKeyW -> fn
 * -> unload -> restore), not just the RegLoadKeyW call itself -- see
 * win_profiles.hpp's with_user_hive() for where it is taken. The live-hive
 * path (the common case) never takes this lock.
 *
 * INSTRUMENTATION: this one process-wide lock already serialises the
 * offline arm for FIVE plugins via with_user_hive() -- autoruns,
 * installed_apps, license_scan, registry, tar -- so a long hold by any one
 * of them blocks the other four with no prior visibility into it. A
 * planned execution_artifacts caller (not yet on this branch) will make it
 * six, calling the lock directly rather than through with_user_hive().
 * `ScopedOfflineHiveLock` wraps the acquire/release with a wait-time and
 * hold-time log (spdlog, this codebase's existing agent-side logging
 * mechanism -- see guard_registry.cpp for the same pattern applied to
 * Guardian's own shared-resource contention) so an unusually long wait or
 * hold is visible without instrumenting every call site by hand. Prefer it
 * over a bare `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>(offline_hive_mutex())` for any
 * new caller; today with_user_hive() (agents/shared/win_profiles.hpp) is
 * the only call site, serving the five plugins above.
