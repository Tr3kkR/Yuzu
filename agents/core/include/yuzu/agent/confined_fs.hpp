/**
 * confined_fs.hpp -- platform shell API for confined recursive delete: a
 * root is pinned ONCE (open/handle held for the lifetime of the operation)
 * and every subsequent read/enumerate/delete is PARENT-HANDLE-RELATIVE
 * (POSIX `*at()` on a held `dir_fd`, Windows `NtCreateFile` with a held
 * parent `HANDLE` as the root object) -- confined_fs.hpp declares this
 * surface; the platform TUs (separate packages, one per OS) define it. This
 * header itself stays syntax-checkable under BOTH `#ifdef` branches on any
 * host, but only one branch's bodies exist on any given build.
 *
 * ── Threat model ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The primitive this header fronts exists to delete content below an
 * attacker-influenced directory (a plugin's staging area, a quarantined
 * download, generated scratch output) WITHOUT trusting that directory's
 * structure. The threat is a symlink or junction swapped in between when an
 * entry is CHECKED (stat/enumerate) and when it is ACTED on (unlink/open) --
 * classic TOCTOU. This is why every operation past `open_root` is
 * PARENT-HANDLE-RELATIVE and NEVER re-resolves a path from a string: once a
 * directory handle is open, later operations address entries BY NAME
 * against that already-open handle, so there is no path string left for an
 * attacker to re-point mid-operation. A freshly `::open()`ed-by-path call
 * anywhere in this flow would reintroduce exactly the race the whole design
 * exists to close.
 *
 * ── InvalidName rule (PLAN-015, adopted) ─────────────────────────────────
 * A name is refused BEFORE any syscall touches it -- never partially
 * processed -- if it is: empty; exactly "." or ".."; contains a '/' (or,
 * additionally on Windows, a '\\'); or contains an EMBEDDED NUL byte. All
 * four are structurally never a legitimate single path COMPONENT, and each
 * one is a known technique for confusing a syscall about which entry it is
 * actually touching (NUL-truncation being the classic one).
 *
 * ── Root-authorization contract (PLAN-009) ───────────────────────────────
 * Confinement here applies STRICTLY BELOW the supplied root: everything
 * this header's functions do stays inside the subtree rooted at whatever
 * `open_root` was given. Deciding whether a root MAY be targeted at all --
 * never "/", never a system directory, never another tenant's tree -- is
 * the CALLER'S authorization policy, enforced at the consuming action layer
 * (PR6.1-a), NOT by this primitive. `open_root` itself refuses only a
 * non-directory or a reparse-point root; it has no opinion on WHICH
 * directories are appropriate targets.
 *
 * ── Zero-adoption ruling: FileIdentity / capture_identity ────────────────
 * `FileIdentity` + `capture_identity` are the ONLY helper hoisted out of the
 * three existing agent-core sites that each already do something in this
 * space -- every other primitive here is new. The three sites keep their
 * own, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT contracts and are NOT migrated onto this
 * header (zero-adoption is final for this PR):
 *
 *   - plugin_loader.cpp:523 (Windows) / :560 (POSIX) has NO dev/ino identity
 *     contract at all -- it pins the loaded inode by HOLDING the handle/fd
 *     open across the hash-then-load sequence (Windows: CreateFileW with
 *     FILE_SHARE_READ only + FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT; POSIX: ::open
 *     with O_RDONLY|O_NOFOLLOW|O_CLOEXEC). That is a share-mode/fd PIN, not
 *     a comparable identity VALUE -- there is no dev:ino pair constructed or
 *     compared anywhere in that flow.
 *   - guardian_state_reader.cpp:95 builds a `dev:ino` STRING
 *     (`file_identity()`) purely as an opaque change-detection token for
 *     convergence bookkeeping -- explicitly "NOT part of any verdict". Its
 *     :317 caller deliberately FOLLOWS reparse points (matches POSIX
 *     symlink-follow semantics for spark-detection reads), the opposite of
 *     this header's NOFOLLOW-everywhere posture.
 *   - updater.cpp:716 re-verifies `st_ino`/`st_dev` between an already-open
 *     fd and a fresh path-based stat as a TOCTOU detector on its own update
 *     temp file, and :568 uses Windows `FileDispositionInfo` to delete an
 *     open temp file by HANDLE on process exit -- both narrowly scoped to
 *     updater.cpp's single-file replace flow, not a general primitive.
 *
 * Each of these has a shape close enough to this header's `FileIdentity`
 * that a naive reviewer might expect adoption; the recorded reasoning here
 * is that none of them are a byte-for-byte match to what this header needs,
 * and forcing them onto a shared type they were not designed for would be a
 * worse outcome than the (small) duplication. A wanted-but-undeclared
 * helper beyond `FileIdentity`/`capture_identity` and `WinHandle` is a flag
 * to the orchestrator, not an invention.
