/**
 * runner_status.hpp — the ONE mapping from a bounded-runner outcome to the
 * ABI4 plugin→host result seam (ADR-3002 acquisition-ladder migration).
 * Consumers: every Wave-2 runner-migration plugin package (users, certificates,
 * discovery, network_actions, wol, quarantine, services, interaction) — the
 * first forwarders of a bounded-runner outcome through this seam.
 *
 * Lives in agents/core (not agents/shared): classify_runner_failure takes a
 * yuzu::agent::SubprocessResult, so it carries a core dependency edge and
 * doesn't qualify as an agents/shared zero-dependency leaf (cpp-conventions.md).
 * Every plugin already links yuzu_agent_core_dep, so this needs no extra
 * meson wiring at any consumer.
 *
 * Maps every outcome EXCEPT `exited`: whether a nonzero exit code is an error
 * is the caller's domain (a nonzero `ping` exit means "host down", not a plugin
 * failure), so `exited` returns nullopt and the caller owns the status (or
 * leaves it for the agent's exit-code derivation).
 *
 * `line_limit` is deliberately NOT in that exemption — it is a truthful
 * OK/PARTIAL, not a silent success. ADR-3002 "Honest termination reporting"
 * names it in the reason enum and requires the reason to survive to the wire,
 * naming the plugin execute() integer return as the narrowing point that must
 * not flatten it.
 *
 * Kept a pure classification + a thin forwarding wrapper so the table is
 * fixture-testable without a context or a spawn.
