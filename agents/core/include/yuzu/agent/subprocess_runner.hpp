/**
 * subprocess_runner.hpp -- agent-core bounded, fork-safe POSIX subprocess
 * runner (#2273 foundation), extended to the full ADR-3002 runner contract
 * (docs/adr/3002-acquisition-ladder.md:537-606) plus the best-practice
 * addendum (A1-A6, B1-B6).
 *
 * Runs a fixed argv (argv[0] MUST be an absolute path -- exec'd via execv(),
 * never execvp(), so there is no PATH search and no shell in between, hence
 * no shell-quoting/injection surface) as a child in its own process group,
 * with a hard wall-clock deadline: if the child hasn't
 * exited by then, its whole process group is SIGKILLed and reaped.
 * Callers that need to end a run early (agent shutdown, an operator
 * cancel) can cooperatively request that via request_subprocess_cancel()
 * -- an in-flight run notices on its next poll and finishes the same way
 * a deadline would -- or, for a SINGLE in-flight call without affecting any
 * other, via a per-invocation CancellationToken (SubprocessOptions::cancel_token).
 *
 * This lives in agent-core rather than as a plugin-local header because the
 * implementation spawns a DETACHED background reaper thread when a killed
 * child can't be confirmed-reaped within a short bound (see
 * subprocess_runner.cpp). That thread's code must never live in memory that
 * can be unmapped out from under it -- which rules out a plugin .dylib/.so,
 * since agent.cpp's reconnect/shutdown paths dlclose() plugins. yuzu_agent_core_lib
 * is linked directly into the yuzu-agent executable and is never dlclose'd,
 * so a helper defined here is a genuine pinned image. Declared here, DEFINED
 * OUT-OF-LINE in subprocess_runner.cpp -- same split as LocalDispatcher
 * (local_dispatcher.hpp / .cpp) -- so the fork/exec/reap machinery compiles
 * only into that pinned image, never into an including plugin.
 *
 * Now genuinely cross-platform: POSIX (fork+execve) and Windows (a real
 * suspended-create -> assign-Job-Object -> resume CreateProcessW backend,
 * replacing the previous stub) both implement the same contract below.

    // false, so every existing caller's launch is bit-for-bit unchanged --
    // this is covered by test_subprocess_launch_spec.cpp's default-value
    // assertion and by test_subprocess_runner.cpp's "extra_env-only, flag
    // unset" launch-spec test.
    //
    // WHY THIS EXISTS: script_exec's Windows leg (deleted CreateProcessA
    // call, pre-runner-migration) passed a null lpEnvironment, so its
    // children inherited the FULL parent environment unfiltered -- unlike
    // the POSIX leg, which always kept an explicit seven-name safe_vars
    // allow-list (PATH/HOME/USER/LANG/LC_ALL/TERM/TZ). Alex ruled AGAINST
    // narrowing that pre-existing Windows behaviour to match POSIX's seven
    // names when this runner replaced script_exec's private spawn paths.
    // extra_env alone cannot express "forward everything the parent has" --
    // it is an explicit, individually-validated, additive allow-list, by
    // design (ADR-3002 A5) -- so this flag is the one narrowly-scoped
    // exception PLAN-04/A2-002 authorizes: it exists ONLY to reproduce
    // script_exec's pre-existing Windows behaviour, not as a general-purpose
    // "give me the parent's environment" facility for any other caller.
    //
    // (a) INTERACTION WITH extra_env: when true, extra_env entries are still
    // applied ON TOP of the inherited parent-environment block, using the
    // SAME replace-in-place-never-duplicate semantics merge_launch_env()
    // always uses (subprocess_launch_spec.hpp) -- extra_env is the base
    // that's swapped from the A5 default to the live parent snapshot, not a
    // rule that stops applying. A caller combining both (as script_exec
    // does, forwarding its own seven-name allow-list on top of the full
    // inherited block) gets: full parent env, with any of those seven names
    // set to exactly the value extra_env specified, even if that differs
    // from what the live parent process itself currently holds.
    //
    // (b) SECURITY: this deliberately bypasses ADR-3002 A5's clear-slate
    // policy for ONE platform -- gated tightly: opt-in, default-off,
    // Windows-only (see below), and every extra_env entry is STILL run
    // through the existing denylist/malformed-entry checks
    // (is_denied_env_name/is_malformed_env_entry) exactly as when this flag
    // is false -- LD_*/DYLD_*/IFS/BASH_ENV/ENV/GCONV_PATH/NLSPATH/LOCPATH
    // remain refused (the whole launch fails closed) regardless of this
    // flag's value; it only changes what UNNAMED variables the child also
    // receives, never what extra_env itself is allowed to name. This exists
    // to preserve pre-existing script_exec behaviour that PREDATES the
    // runner -- it is not, and must never become, a general-purpose "inherit
    // everything" facility for a caller with no equivalent legacy
    // requirement.
    //
    // (c) POSIX: intentionally IGNORED -- read (mirrored onto
    // LaunchOptions::inherit_parent_env, subprocess_launch_spec.hpp) but
    // never acted on by the POSIX backend in subprocess_runner.cpp, which
    // always builds envp from spec.env (the ordinary A5-allow-list-plus-
    // extra_env computation) regardless of this flag. Two independent
    // reasons, not just "not implemented yet": (1) POSIX already has no gap
    // to fill -- script_exec's deleted POSIX fork/execvpe path ALREADY used
    // an explicit safe_vars allow-list, so extra_env alone (no widening
    // needed) already reproduces it exactly, which is what this same PR's
    // script_exec plugin change does; (2) Alex's ruling was scoped to
    // preserving the WINDOWS leg's pre-existing behaviour specifically --
    // extending a blanket "inherit everything" primitive to POSIX as well
    // would be a materially different, unauthorized widening of A5 on the
    // platform that never had this gap. A future caller with a genuine

 * absolute path (same contract as run_bounded_subprocess's argv[0]) AND
 * exists AND is executable, or an empty string if none match. Useful when a
 * tool's location varies (e.g. `ip` differs across distros). "Executable"
 * is judged per backend as "this runner could spawn it": POSIX = regular
 * file + access(X_OK); Windows = not a spawn-banned .bat/.cmd/.com and a
 * real executable image (GetBinaryTypeW), K2/CDX-P2-003.
 *
 * Honestly noted (ADR-3002): this is a stat-then-exec probe, so it is still
 * a filesystem TOCTOU if an attacker can replace the probed binary between
 * the probe and the later exec -- root-owned tool directories are the
 * mitigation, not this function. For a stronger guarantee, pair the probed
 * path with SubprocessOptions::exec_verify (B6).
