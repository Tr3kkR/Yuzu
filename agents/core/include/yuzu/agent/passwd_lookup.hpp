/**
 * passwd_lookup.hpp -- bounded, POSIX passwd-database resolution for the agent
 * (#3406).
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES IN AGENT-CORE AND NOT IN THE PLUGIN THAT NEEDS IT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * The only consumer today is the macOS `certificates` plugin, which resolves
 * the console user's uid + home directory before reading their login keychain.
 * The obvious implementation -- call `yuzu::shared::bounded_call()` straight
 * from the plugin -- is UNSAFE, and the tree already says so in as many words.
 * `bounded_call` runs its callable on a DETACHED thread and abandons it at the
 * deadline; if that callable's code lives in a plugin's shared object, the
 * agent can `dlclose()` the plugin while the detached thread is still executing
 * inside it, and the process dies on unmapped text. See
 * agents/core/src/server_address_resolver.cpp, which uses the same primitive
 * and documents the constraint explicitly: safe there "specifically because
 * this whole translation unit lives in agent-core, never dlclose()'d ... the
 * risk this exact shape would carry inside a PLUGIN."
 *
 * So the bounded lookup lives here, in agent-core, for exactly the same reason
 * subprocess_runner's reaper thread does: agent-core is never unloaded, so a
 * late-arriving result from an abandoned thread is simply discarded instead of
 * racing an unload.
 *
 * WHY IT IS BOUNDED AT ALL
 * ------------------------
 * `getpwnam_r` is not a local-file read on a directory-joined Mac -- it can do
 * a blocking network Directory Services / NSS lookup with no caller-supplied
 * timeout, a hazard this repo already records at
 * agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_proc_es.cpp ("getpwuid_r -- which can do a
 * blocking network NSS lookup on a directory-joined Mac"). Before #3406 the
 * certificates plugin obtained this same information through CHILD PROCESSES
 * (`/bin/sh -c` performing `~user` tilde expansion, and `/usr/bin/id -u`), both
 * of which the bounded subprocess runner could SIGKILL at a deadline. Moving
 * the lookup in-process removed that kill boundary: an uncancellable blocking
 * call on the agent's bounded ThreadPool can pin a worker indefinitely, and
 * enough of them exhaust the pool and stall unrelated commands
 * (agents/shared/bounded_wait.hpp's own rationale). Bounding the WAIT here
 * restores the property the child process used to provide.

 * On timeout the underlying lookup is ABANDONED, not cancelled (there is no
 * portable way to cancel it) -- it finishes on its own detached thread and its
 * result is discarded. The caller is never blocked past `timeout`. A
 * non-positive `timeout` returns kTimeout without starting a lookup at all.
 *
 * On timeout the underlying lookup is ABANDONED, not cancelled, and its
 * detached thread occupies one of `bounded_call`'s PROCESS-GLOBAL
 * `kMaxOutstandingBoundedCalls` slots until it finishes. That counter is shared
 * with every other bounded_call consumer in the agent -- notably
 * `server_address_resolver`'s reconnect-time `getaddrinfo` and discovery's
 * reverse-DNS -- so a sustained directory-services black hole here can consume
 * slots those need, and they degrade to their own nullopt (for the resolver, a
 * spurious "could not resolve" at reconnect). Degraded-but-correct in every
 * case, never a wrong answer, but it is a cross-subsystem coupling worth
 * knowing about before raising this call's timeout or its call rate.
