/**
 * confined_fs_walk.hpp -- PURE, header-only, Ops-parameterised iterative
 * walker for confined recursive delete (PLAN-010: centralises the semantics
 * PLAN-001/002/014 bind, so both platform legs -- and their sight-unseen
 * authors -- share ONE walk implementation instead of two hand-copies that
 * drift). No OS headers: only confined_fs_rules.hpp plus <optional>,
 * <utility>, <vector>, <string>.
 *
 * `Ops` is a compile-time interface (duck-typed template parameter, no
 * virtual dispatch) a platform shell provides:
 *
 *   using DirHandle = /-- move-only handle type (fd, HANDLE, whatever) --/;
 *   OpenDirRes<DirHandle> open_dir(DirHandle& parent, const std::string& name);
 *   EnumerateResult enumerate(DirHandle& dir, const EnumBudget&);
 *   UnlinkOutcome unlink(DirHandle& parent, const std::string& name, UnlinkKind,
 *                        std::uint64_t max_bytes_remaining);
 *   std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point now();
 *
 * `walk_delete` itself never opens a path, never resolves a symlink, and
 * never allocates OS resources -- it only calls the four `Ops` members above
 * and asks `decide_entry` what to do with what they return. A test TU can
 * therefore drive it end-to-end with a fake in-memory `Ops` and zero
 * disk access (test_confined_fs_walk.cpp).
 *
 * ── Binding walker semantics ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  1. `deadline = ops.now() + limits.max_wall` (SATURATING -- an extreme
 *     max_wall clamps to time_point::max rather than overflowing) is
 *     computed EXACTLY ONCE, at
 *     the start of the walk -- never re-derived per directory or per entry
 *     (a re-derived deadline would let the wall-time cap creep forward
 *     indefinitely on a slow walk).
 *  2. Traversal is an EXPLICIT ITERATIVE STACK of `{DirHandle, rel_prefix,
 *     depth}` frames -- no recursion, so a deep/adversarial directory tree
 *     cannot blow the call stack. The root frame is depth 0.
 *  3. Each directory is enumerated with
 *     `EnumBudget{max_entries - tally.entries_seen (0 if already exhausted),
 *     deadline}`.
 *       - Enumeration truncated with `WallTimeCap`: stop IMMEDIATELY --
 *         the entries collected before truncation are NOT processed --
 *         `stop_reason = WallTimeCap`.
 *       - Enumeration truncated with `EntryCap`: the entries it DID
 *         return are processed normally, and the walk then stops with
 *         `stop_reason = EntryCap`. This holds whether the truncated
 *         batch was empty or not -- a directory larger than the budget
 *         must never report `stop_reason = None`, which a caller is
 *         entitled to read as "the tree was exhaustively visited".
 *       - `EnumerateResult::reason == OsError`: append
 *         `EntryOutcome{<this dir's rel_path>, Failed, OsError, os_error}`
 *         and continue on to the NEXT sibling on the stack (the walk is
 *         not stopped by one unreadable directory) -- but the walk REMEMBERS
 *         that a subtree went unvisited and reports `OsError` as its
 *         `stop_reason` at the end rather than `None`, which would claim an
 *         exhaustive visit.
 *  4. Per collected entry, in order:
 *       - `stat_error != 0` -> append `Failed(OsError, stat_error)`,
 *         `entries_seen++`, continue to the next entry.
 *       - `name_invalid` -> append `Skipped(InvalidName)`, `entries_seen++`,
 *         continue (never reaches match or deletion).
 *       - Otherwise, the LAZY MATCH protocol (PLAN-001): call
 *         `decide_entry` first with `name_matched = true`. `MatchFn` is
 *         called ONLY if that decision's rule sits AT OR AFTER the
 *         name-match rule in the binding order -- i.e. the resulting
 *         action is `Unlink`, or `SkipEntry` with `reason == ByteCap`
 *         (both rules that fire strictly after the name-match check). Any
 *         other outcome (a structural rejection, a cap stop) means
 *         `decide_entry` never needed `name_matched` at all, so `MatchFn`
 *         is never invoked for it. When the real match is needed, it is
 *         evaluated inside a try/catch: a throw sets
 *         `stop_reason = MatchError` and returns the PARTIAL result built
 *         so far. Otherwise `decide_entry` is re-invoked with the real
 *         `name_matched` value and the walker acts on THAT decision.
 *  5. Acting on the (possibly re-evaluated) decision:
 *       - `Unlink`: call `ops.unlink(parent, name, File, remaining byte
 *         budget)` -- the leg RE-MEASURES the entry immediately before
 *         deleting and returns `Skipped(ByteCap)` if the live size would
 *         breach the budget; append
 *         `Deleted` or `Failed(reason, os_error)` per the outcome;
 *         `entries_seen++` always; `bytes_deleted += outcome.bytes` (the
 *         size the leg MEASURED, not the enumerated one) ONLY on a
 *         successful delete.
 *       - `RecurseIntoDir`: call `ops.open_dir`. A POLICY refusal
 *         (`SymlinkRejected`/`ReparseRejected`/`DeviceBoundary`/
 *         `NotRegularFile`/`InvalidName`) appends `Skipped(reason)`; an
 *         `OsError` refusal appends `Failed(OsError, os_error)`
 *         (PLAN-002); success pushes a new stack frame. `entries_seen++`
 *         either way.
 *       - `SkipEntry`: `entries_seen++`; append an outcome UNLESS
 *         `reason == NameFilteredOut`, which is intentionally left
 *         UNRECORDED (bounded-output rule -- a filtered-out tree must not
 *         blow up `DeleteResult::entries` to the size of the whole subtree)
 *         but IS still counted in `entries_seen`.
 *       - `StopWalk`: `stop_reason = reason`; return immediately.
 *  6. Directories are TRAVERSED, never deleted -- `RecurseIntoDir` never
 *     reaches `ops.unlink`. `rel_path` components are joined with `/`.
 *  7. EXCEPTION FIREWALL (PLAN-014): the entire walk body runs inside one
 *     outer try/catch(...). Any exception that is not the deliberately
 *     caught `MatchFn` throw (rule 4) is caught here, `stop_reason` is set
 *     to `Internal`, and the best-effort partial result built so far is
 *     returned. `walk_delete` lets NO exception escape to its caller.
