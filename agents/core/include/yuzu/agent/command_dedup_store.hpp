/**
 * command_dedup_store.hpp -- Durable agent-side command idempotency + outcome replay
 *
 * HA delivery-matrix WS-0 (ADR-2002). Replaces the process-lifetime, in-memory
 * `dedup_current_`/`dedup_previous_` sets (cleared on every reconnect) with a
 * SQLite-backed store, file at {data_dir}/command_dedup.db, that survives an
 * agent restart AND remembers each command's TERMINAL outcome so a duplicate
 * replays the ORIGINAL result rather than a bare REJECTED.
 *
 * Why replay matters: the server's at-least-once delivery (and, later, the WS-1
 * transactional outbox) can redeliver a command whose first terminal ack was
 * lost. Without outcome replay the honest guarantee is only "effect-once,
 * result-maybe-lost": the side effect ran once, but the operator sees REJECTED
 * and the real SUCCESS/output is gone. This store closes that. It is
 * effectively-once, NOT exactly-once (ADR-2002 §Guarantees): a command claimed
 * but not yet resolved when the agent crashes is answered INDETERMINATE
 * (RUNNING) on redelivery and never silently re-executed — re-running a
 * destructive command is the one failure the whole HA design forbids.
 *
 * Durability: the store opens with `journal_mode=WAL` AND `synchronous=FULL`.
 * FULL (not the WAL default NORMAL) fsyncs each commit, so a claim/terminal
 * record survives a HOST failure (power-loss), not only a process crash — which
 * is the failure mode HA actually cares about. The write rate is one row per
 * command, not a hot path, so the fsync cost is negligible against command
 * latency.
 *
 * Lifecycle (one claim resolves exactly once):
 *   claim(id)  -> Claimed   : first sighting; the caller owns the in-flight
 *                             record and MUST resolve it via record_terminal()
 *                             (executed to a terminal outcome) or release()
 *                             (never executed — e.g. the dispatch queue was
 *                             full, a transient condition that must re-attempt).
 *              -> Duplicate : already known — the caller must NOT execute. If
 *                             Terminal, replay `response`; if InFlight, answer
 *                             RUNNING (indeterminate).
 *              -> Error     : store write failed; the caller proceeds WITHOUT
 *                             dedup for this one command — a DELIBERATE fail-OPEN
 *                             to availability (ADR-2002): when the durable store
 *                             cannot function no dedup mechanism can, and the
 *                             chosen degradation is at-least-once (a redelivery
 *                             may re-execute) rather than refusing the command
 *                             and dropping the endpoint out of remote-control
 *                             reach. This is degraded, not wrong, and the caller
 *                             is expected to make it OBSERVABLE (a counter/tag),
 *                             never silent.
 *
 * Retention is a clock-free rowid ring over TERMINAL rows only (keep the most
 * recent kMaxDedupRows). Deliberately NOT a wall-clock delete, so it sidesteps
 * the clock-guarded-retention hazard (routed concern #2360/#2361) entirely on an
 * endpoint whose clock the user controls; `claimed_at` is diagnostic ONLY and
 * MUST NEVER become a retention cutoff. IN-FLIGHT rows are NEVER evicted by the
 * ring: a live command's claim can never be pruned out from under its still-
 * running worker (the double-execution that would otherwise occur under high
 * volume). The only cost is that a crashed-mid-execution in-flight row (response
 * is NULL, so ~tens of bytes) persists until the agent is reinstalled; bounding
 * that with a stale-in-flight reconciliation is a tracked follow-up, not a
 * slice-1 concern (crash-looping is the larger problem, and the rows are tiny).
 *
 * Thread-safe: a std::mutex serialises every sqlite3* operation. The reader
 * thread calls claim()/release() and the bounded dispatch-pool workers call
 * record_terminal() concurrently; the DB is the synchronisation point.
 * claim()/record_terminal()/release() are noexcept: a store failure degrades
 * durability, it never propagates into the command hot path.
