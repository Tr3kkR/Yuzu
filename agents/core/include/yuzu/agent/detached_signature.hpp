/// Verification of a detached PEM CMS signature over a local file, against an
/// operator-supplied PEM trust bundle.
///
/// WHY IT IS SHARED. This is the plugin loader's verifier, lifted so the OTA
/// update path can use the same one (#416/#3807). Two independent verifiers for
/// "is this binary the one my operator authorised" would be two places to get
/// the CMS flags wrong, and the flags here are load-bearing enough that two
/// separate governance findings are pinned in the comments below.
///
/// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not bind a signature to a filename or a version.
/// The signature covers file CONTENT only. Callers that need a name or version
/// binding must provide it themselves — the plugin loader does so with its
/// allowlist, and the updater does so with the server-supplied SHA-256 and the
/// semver downgrade check, both of which it applies BEFORE getting here.

///     could be repointed at a different inode between the hash and the
///     signature check.
///  2. On Windows it is not optional. The updater stages its download with
///     `dwShareMode=0`, so nothing — including this process — can open that path
///     a second time while the handle is held. A path-based verifier would fail
///     with a sharing violation on every Windows update.

/// The descriptor's file offset is saved and restored, and the descriptor is NOT
/// closed; the caller keeps ownership. On Windows, pass a CRT descriptor obtained
/// from a DUPLICATED handle, so closing it cannot disturb the caller's own.
