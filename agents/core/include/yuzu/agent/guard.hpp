/**
 * guard.hpp — common Guardian guard abstraction shared by every Spark type.
 *
 * A guard is a live, kernel-notified watch on one piece of endpoint state that
 * reports drift to a sink. RegistryGuard (`registry-change`) and FileGuard
 * (`file-change`) implement IGuard; the GuardianEngine owns them polymorphically
 * (`unordered_map<rule_id, unique_ptr<IGuard>>`) and turns each GuardDrift into a
 * GuaranteedStateEvent.
 *
 * Proto-free and windows.h-free by design — keeps protobuf's headers and
 * windows.h's ERROR/min/max macros out of the same translation unit as the
 * guards. Header-only: no exported symbols (pure interface + a POD drift struct).
