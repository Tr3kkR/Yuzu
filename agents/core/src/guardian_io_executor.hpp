/**
 * guardian_io_executor.hpp - a bounded, cancellable, single-flight I/O executor
 * for the Guardian spark state reader (ADR-0021 Stage 2 rung 5, F3) and, since
 * rung 9c (R5.1), the non-waiting dispatch form Guardian's arm/disarm consumer uses.
 *
 * WHY: the IStateReader contract (guardian_spark_runtime.hpp) requires every read
 * be bounded/cancellable - a convergence-lane join and the consumer detach both
 * wait on an in-flight read, so a platform call that can block indefinitely (a
 * wedged SCM, a stalled sd-bus broker, a FUSE/network filesystem hang) must carry
 * a deadline and degrade to Unknown rather than hang agent shutdown. A thread
 * wedged in a D-state syscall CANNOT be cancelled or joined; we do NOT force-cancel
 * the kernel call. Instead we DECOUPLE the caller from it: run the blocking read on
 * a detached worker, wait with an absolute deadline + a stop signal, and degrade to
 * a typed failure the reader maps to Unknown. Spawn-per-read (not a pool): the
 * workload is cold (convergence 60s/5-15min lanes, events debounced) and a pool
 * only adds a stale-job queue plus the same wedged-worker problem.
 *
 * TWO DISPATCH FORMS (rung 9c R5.1):
 *  - run(): the caller BLOCKS for the result with an absolute deadline; a late
 *    result is routed to the optional on_abandoned callback (#3816).
 *  - submit(): the caller does NOT block. Admission is still synchronous and
 *    identical; the result is handed to on_complete(IoResult<T>&&) on the worker
 *    thread after fn() returns. A non-waiting call can dispatch a fresh operation
 *    from inside its completion ("refill"), and that refill must not be starved by
 *    its own predecessor's still-held slot - which is why submit() releases quota
 *    at fn() return (below), and why a separate PHYSICAL ceiling exists.
 *
 * INVARIANTS (each is a Sol BLOCKING/SHOULD fix, code-verified; R5.1 additions marked):
 *  - Keyed single-flight: an op key = (IoClass, spark_key) is held from admission
 *    until the RELEASE POINT of the dispatch form (table below). A run/submit for an
 *    already-active key returns AlreadyRunning WITHOUT spawning. The key is the
 *    canonical spark_key (length-prefixed, injective) and EXCLUDES the file hash-cap
 *    and the registry value plan - those can change while the same physical read
 *    is stuck, and letting that change bypass single-flight recreates the
 *    wedged-slot bug. The caller never releases a key in either form.
 *  - TWO COUNTS, not one (R5.1): a QUOTA-HELD count (per class + total, what
 *    admission checks against the class quotas) and a PHYSICAL ALIVE count (every
 *    worker whose payload has not yet been destroyed in the trampoline - the latest
 *    self-observable point before its OS thread exits - what active_worker_count() /
 *    Stats::active_* report and what GuardianEngine::active_io_workers() sums for
 *    the F3 orphan grace - #4147). They diverge only for submit(): its worker frees quota
 *    at fn() return but stays alive through on_complete.
 *  - Per-type bulkheads: per-class quota-held quotas (File/Registry/Service) PLUS a
 *    total bound derived as their sum (rung 9a R3, exact bulkheads), so a dead
 *    mount saturating the file lane never starves a healthy service reconcile.
 *    Combined with single-flight so one key cannot eat its whole type budget.
 *  - PHYSICAL CEILING (R5.1): admission is also refused (CeilingExhausted) once
 *    alive_total >= alive_ceiling = kAliveCeilingFactor * total_quota, regardless
 *    of quota availability. Quota alone no longer bounds alive workers once a
 *    completion callback can outlive its slot. The factor is a policy allowance,
 *    not a structural proof (successive submissions can reuse released quota while
 *    earlier callbacks are still alive), so the ceiling is a per-instance backstop
 *    that can impose cross-class back-pressure; a hit means workers are outstanding
 *    past fn() with quota free (slow or wedged callbacks, delayed ticket release),
 *    NOT that a backend target is dead. Provably inert for run()-only workloads:
 *    run() holds quota until its payload is destroyed, so alive == quota_held <= total_quota <
 *    ceiling. The quota check runs before the ceiling check, so CeilingExhausted is
 *    only ever reported when quota has room - the one diagnostically distinct case.
 *  - RAII admission ticket: admission is a transaction (the one throwing mutation,
 *    set::insert, runs before the nothrow counter increments; the ticket is armed
 *    last). A shared_ptr<TicketCore> owns the slot + active key. Release points:
 *
 *        form                 | single-flight key        | quota slot            | physical (alive)
 *        run(), published     | worker publish           | ~TicketCore (payload dtor) | ~TicketCore
 *        run(), abandoned     | ~TicketCore              | ~TicketCore           | ~TicketCore
 *        submit()             | release_quota_locked() at fn() return, before on_complete | same call | ~TicketCore
 *
 *    ~TicketCore runs when the LAST holder dies - the worker's own captured copy,
 *    destroyed by the trampoline after the worker lambda has fully returned: the
 *    latest point the detached thread can self-observe before it exits. The tail
 *    after that decrement - the State handle release, cv.notify_all, payload
 *    deallocation, the trampoline epilogue and the CRT thread exit - runs only
 *    process-lifetime runtime code (libstdc++/libc/pthread or the CRT), never the
 *    Guardian, OpenSSL, libsystemd or Win32-RPC code F3 exists to keep out of DSO
 *    teardown. NO grace covers that tail: wait_for_workers_to_drain() returns on
 *    the first zero it reads and main.cpp/service_win.cpp skip the wait outright
 *    when the initial sample is zero (hard_exit.hpp). The exposure is identical for
 *    every run() worker since rung 7 and is accepted; a self-decremented count
 *    cannot certify its own thread's exit (adversarial review rounds 1-3, C3/C1).
 *    A timed-out run() submitter does NOT release
 *    anything - the worker does, on its own schedule. Exactly-once decrement
 *    handshake: `quota_released` flips under the same State::mu acquisition as the
 *    quota decrement, and the destructor decrements quota only if it is still
 *    false, so no path can double-decrement (a double-decrement would inflate the
 *    quota and silently oversubscribe the lane).
 *  - No std::terminate path: the worker is launched DETACHED-at-creation
 *    (pthread_create PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED / _beginthreadex + CloseHandle), so
 *    there is no joinable std::thread whose destructor could terminate and no
 *    detach() that could throw. The worker trampoline is fully exception-contained
 *    (only the user fn() may throw, and it is caught). run() heap-boxes its result
 *    and publishes into the cell by a nothrow unique_ptr move, so publication
 *    cannot throw for any result type (including MSVC's std::unordered_map, whose
 *    move is not noexcept). submit() has no cross-thread publication: its result
 *    lives on the worker's own stack (std::optional, in-place) and is moved into
 *    on_complete directly, so it has neither a box nor a null-box case.
 *  - Typed outcome: std::expected<T, IoFailure>; the reader maps each IoFailure to
 *    a precise bounded Unknown string (it lands in guard.unhealthy detail).
 *  - Absolute deadline captured at run() ENTRY (per-class deadline chosen by the
 *    reader), so allocation + launch time counts against the caller's budget.
 *    submit() takes NO deadline: there is no waiter to time out, a wedged fn()
 *    holds its slot and key for as long as it stays wedged (the dead-target
 *    bulkhead is unchanged), and per-key deadlines/quarantine are the consumer's
 *    (design doc R5.2/R5.3, rung 9c PR-5).
 *  - Exactly-once result delivery (#3816, run()): every result fn() returns normally
 *    goes to exactly one of run()'s return value (caller still waiting) or the
 *    optional on_abandoned(T&&) callback (caller already timed out / the executor
 *    is stopping). The wait-side lock is acquired ONCE, before spawn_detached, and
 *    held across launch into cv.wait_until - so the caller's abandon decision and
 *    the worker's publish decision always serialize on the SAME mutex acquisition
 *    (a plain ResultCell::abandoned bool, no atomics needed) and there is no
 *    window after a caller gives up where a late success has nowhere race-free to
 *    go. A mutex-lock failure on this ONE acquisition can only happen before the
 *    worker exists (folds into IoFailure::LaunchFailed, #saf3821-5's test seam is
 *    set_throw_before_wait_lock_for_test); cv.wait_until's own internal re-lock on
 *    wake is not a throwing failure mode (std::terminate per the standard if it
 *    cannot reacquire), so there is no catchable post-launch failure to guard.
 *  - Exactly-once completion (R5.1, submit()): if submit() returns success, then
 *    on_complete fires exactly once, on the worker thread, if and when the admitted
 *    operation finishes (a WorkerThrew is delivered through the same callback; a
 *    permanently stuck fn() never delivers). It never fires on an admission
 *    failure, not even synchronously - so a caller's rollback of pre-dispatch
 *    bookkeeping can never double up with a callback. It DOES fire after stop()
 *    (counted as completed_after_stop): this executor is T-agnostic and cannot
 *    clean up a late-succeeding arm, so suppressing the callback would be the
 *    #3816 leak class; the consumer's own stopping branch decides what a late
 *    result means (R5.5). It may run BEFORE submit() returns to the caller (a fast
 *    fn()), so every piece of caller-side bookkeeping the callback relies on must
 *    exist before submit() is called. There is no wait-lock held across spawn on
 *    the submit side: run() needs that to serialize the caller's abandon decision
 *    with the worker's publish decision, and submit() has no caller-side decision
 *    after admission. The caller drops its ticket copy unlocked after launch; in
 *    the worst case it is the last holder and the physical decrement runs on the
 *    caller thread LATE (after the worker already returned), never early - safe
 *    for F3 and the ceiling. A throwing on_complete is contained and counted
 *    (completion_failures); the slot and key were already released before it ran.
 *  - Nested dispatch from on_complete is legal (R5.1 refill): the predecessor's
 *    slot and key are already released and the callback thread holds no executor
 *    lock, so a run()/submit() on the same executor (same key included) from inside
 *    on_complete admits normally. A callback that BLOCKS in a nested run() counts
 *    as one alive worker holding no quota for as long as it blocks.
 *  - Every worker body wears GuardianDetachedWorkerRole (both forms) from its first
 *    statement, and destroys its owned user callables (fn, on_abandoned /
 *    on_complete) inside that marked scope, so fn(), the callbacks and their
 *    capture destructors all run marked: any GuardianEngine::mtx_ acquisition on the
 *    thread aborts in debug/sanitizer builds (WorkerHostileMutex's second role,
 *    guardian_detached_worker_role.hpp). The ticket's own destruction, by the
 *    trampoline after the lambda returns, is outside the marked scope and takes
 *    only State::mu.
 *
 * ORPHAN PROCESS-EXIT CONTRACT (rung-5 scope: expose + document; ENFORCEMENT
 * LANDED rung 7, see below):
 *  A shared_ptr keeps State (and, for run(), the result cell) alive for a wedged
 *  detached worker, so there is no use-after-free. It does NOT make it safe for
 *  that worker to run libc / OpenSSL / libsystemd / Win32-RPC code THROUGH normal
 *  C++ static/DSO teardown. The process MUST NOT perform normal C++ teardown while
 *  active_worker_count() > 0. That count is the PHYSICAL ALIVE count (#4147): it
 *  includes a submit() worker that has already returned from fn() and released
 *  its quota but is still inside on_complete, and it is bounded per instance by
 *  alive_ceiling. Rung 5 exposed that count (total + per class) here and
 *  re-exposed it through GuardianStateReader; rung 7's hard_exit.hpp is the
 *  enforcement: main.cpp/service_win.cpp construct an OrphanExitGuard before
 *  Agent::run(), sample guardian_active_io_workers() after it returns, and
 *  hard_exit() (TerminateProcess/_exit, skipping normal teardown entirely) if
 *  still nonzero after a bounded grace. Verified on POSIX (full test suite +
 *  TSan + real boot/SIGTERM smoke tests); the Windows SCM path
 *  (service_win.cpp) needs a DGRHP build+run before it's considered verified
 *  the same way. GuardianEngine's spark path is wired at agent boot since rung
 *  7.7a (agent.cpp, the wire_spark_engine() call site) with prefer_spark false,
 *  so the arm/disarm executor exists in production but sees no traffic until the
 *  flip; the state-read executor is live wherever spark state reads run.
