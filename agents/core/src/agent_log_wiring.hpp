/// #4666 PR-2: the thin per-image install/release protocol wrapping LogHandoff
/// (log_handoff.hpp) for main.cpp's (and, later, a multi-image test fixture's) real
/// call sites. HEADER-ONLY ON PURPOSE, no matching .cpp: on a platform with more than
/// one spdlog registry per process (macOS -- see log_handoff.hpp's own MULTI-IMAGE
/// note), the code below must physically execute inside whichever image includes it,
/// so that image's OWN spdlog::set_default_logger() call lands in its OWN registry.
/// A .cpp compiled once into agent-core would only ever touch agent-core's registry --
/// #include this header directly instead, once per image that needs to install/release.
///
/// R-LOGGER (the one rule that matters most): LogHandoff::install() returns a
/// shared_ptr<spdlog::logger> that CO-OWNS the logger and its sinks alongside
/// LogHandoff's own internal logger_ member (see log_handoff.hpp's TEARDOWN CONTRACT,
/// step T3). teardown()'s T3 only resets LogHandoff's OWN reference -- it has no way to
/// reach a copy a caller is still holding. Every function below drops its
/// install()-returned reference before returning; nothing here ever hands that
/// shared_ptr back to a caller. If a future change to this file breaks that, the final
/// sink close (e.g. a rotating-file sink's fclose()) happens whenever the leaked
/// reference finally drops -- possibly long after teardown()'s own bounded watchdog has
/// already given up and moved on, defeating the entire point of bounding shutdown.
///
/// LogHandoffEpilogue's declaration-order contract: declare it IMMEDIATELY after the
/// LogHandoff it wraps is constructed, and before anything that might still be logging
/// (e.g. the Agent object) -- C++ destroys stack/member locals in the REVERSE of
/// declaration order, so this ordering is what makes the epilogue's destructor (which
/// swaps this image's default logger to a null sink and then calls LogHandoff::teardown(),
/// see log_handoff.hpp's THREAD-SAFETY CONTRACT / TEARDOWN CONTRACT) run AFTER every
/// later-declared object has already been destroyed and can no longer log.
