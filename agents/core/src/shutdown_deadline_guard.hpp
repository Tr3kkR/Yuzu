/// #2233 item 3 ("S+"): a pre-armed, whole-call shutdown deadline. hard_exit.hpp's
/// OrphanExitGuard is a POST-HOC drain poll — constructed before Agent::run(), checked
/// only after it returns — and does not cover a hang DURING teardown itself. The only
/// existing escalation, main.cpp's second-SIGINT hard_exit(1), is human/external-signal-
/// only, never a timer (see common/include/yuzu/shutdown_watcher.hpp's own former "no
/// internal bound" comment, which this file supersedes). ShutdownDeadlineGuard is that
/// missing internal bound: construct it as the first statement of a call that must not
/// hang (AgentImpl::stop(), run()'s teardown ScopeExit); on scope exit it cancels; if the
/// wrapped call is still running when the grace period elapses, it calls hard_exit()
/// directly, without acquiring any lock the wrapped call might be holding.
///
/// WHY hard_exit() STAYS SAFE even with a legitimately in-flight, uncancellable worker
/// (e.g. a plugin-ABI call nothing can interrupt): hard_exit() skips ALL normal teardown —
/// no join, no destructor runs, no unwinding — rather than trying to wait for or cancel
/// anything. A worker "still running" at the moment of hard_exit() is a non-issue by
/// construction. (A prior attempt at an internal deadline failed review three times
/// specifically because it was designed against an idle agent and didn't reason through
/// this; that reasoning is why this design is safe where that one wasn't.)

/// where skipping it matters most. Neither this class nor its worker ever lets an
/// exception escape uncaught — every failure mode routes to hard_exit(), fail-closed,
/// because the callers this exists for (AgentImpl::stop()) are themselves noexcept, and
/// a construction failure reaching std::terminate() instead of hard_exit() would run CRT
/// abort handling on Windows — not equivalent to TerminateProcess, and exactly the
