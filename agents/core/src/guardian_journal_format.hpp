/**
 * guardian_journal_format.hpp -- pure on-disk format for the Guardian durable
 * lifecycle-audit journal (item 7, PR-Ag; design rev 4.1:
 * docs/spark-item7-lifecycle-journal-design.md).
 *
 * This TU is the SUBSTRATE ONLY: the record shape, the kv_store key/namespace
 * scheme, the caps, mint-time field validation, and batch (de)serialization.
 * It has NO wiring, NO KvStore access, NO threads - it is deterministic and
 * unit-testable in isolation. Staging, persistence, retention, and replay layer
 * on top of this in later commits.
 *
 * A JournalRecord is FROZEN AT MINT: every field it carries is exactly what was
 * (or will be) sent on the wire, so a replay reconstructs a byte-identical
 * GuaranteedStateEvent and the server's redelivery compare (PR-Sv) sees a match,
 * not a false Conflict. Nothing here is ever re-stamped or re-measured.

/// Why both caps. Each batch is a separate autocommit insert that can approach the KvStore's
/// 5 s busy timeout under contention, so the BATCH cap is what bounds a tick's worst case
/// (~4 x 5 s, inside the 30 s heartbeat) instead of leaving it unbounded. But a batch is
/// capped at kMaxJournalEntriesPerBatch entries AND kMaxJournalBatchBytes, so how many
/// RECORDS four batches carry depends entirely on record size: ~1024 when records are small
/// and batches fill on the entry cap, but as few as ~48 when large fields make the byte cap
/// split them - a 21x swing in sustained drain rate, from ~34 rec/s down to ~1.6 rec/s
/// (governance Gate 3 performance). The heartbeat tick is the only steady-state drain, so at
/// the low end a sustained event rate the pre-cap code absorbed would instead overflow the
/// bounded staging buffer and shed records through the counted journal_stage_dropped path.
/// That would be a NEW loss channel introduced by a latency fix, which is not a trade worth
/// making silently.
///
/// The RECORD cap therefore floors the throughput independently of record size: whichever
/// limit is reached first ends the call, so the tick is bounded in round trips AND the drain
