/**
 * dex_linux_proc.hpp — pure parsers for the Linux /proc DEX signals (Guardian DEX).
 *
 * The Linux DEX collector (dex_linux_collector.cpp) is all-poll: it reads
 * /proc/stat, /proc/meminfo and /proc/mounts on a slow cadence and feeds the
 * derived numbers into the SAME sustained-breach hysteresis + observation
 * builders the Windows poller uses (dex_perf_breach.hpp, dex_win_poll.hpp). A
 * Linux server therefore lights up the EXISTING perf.cpu_sustained /
 * perf.memory_pressure / storage.low buckets with ZERO server change — the
 * macOS-collector parity playbook (a server is observed the same as any other OS,
 * in the same dashboard rows).
 *
 * Everything here is a PURE text parse (no syscalls, no platform guards) so the
 * fiddly /proc field handling is unit-tested on every host against captured
 * fixtures, exactly like extract_named_data and the dex_perf_breach derivations.
 * Parsers NEVER throw (std::from_chars, not stoull): a malformed /proc line must
 * not unwind out of the poll thread (the dex_observer parse_int_field rule).
 *
 * Namespace `lnx`, not `linux`: `linux` is a predefined macro (== 1) under the
 * gnu++ dialects, so `namespace linux { … }` would not compile portably.
