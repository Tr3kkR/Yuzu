/**
 * guardian_arm_ack.hpp - rung 9c PR-2 ack bookkeeping (Unit 5: built and
 * tested standalone; Unit 6: wired into the live apply_rules()/heartbeat path).
 * See docs/spark-stage2-guardian-consumer-design.md §R5.3.
 *
 * GuardianArmAckLedger tracks ONE outstanding "application" - the set of rules
 * a single apply_rules() push accepted for spark arming
 * (GuardianEngine::ReconcileOutcome::Accepted) - so a heartbeat-bounded drain
 * (§R5.3) can tell whether a generation may advance, and a same-generation
 * full_sync retry can be told apart from a genuinely new or changed push
 * (§R5.3's own duplicate-retry language: "A same-generation re-push ... is a
 * no-op while every outstanding episode for that generation is still
 * genuinely pending ... and only triggers a full re-apply once something has
 * actually failed, expired, or the push's content has changed underneath
 * it"). Most Accepted receipts genuinely have not yet resolved when added -
 * but a re-observed Wedged receipt (rung 9c PR-5c, #4221 up-2) is already
 * terminal the moment it is registered; the ledger does not distinguish the
 * two cases, it just drains whatever each receipt's own status reports.
 *
 * Built and independently tested here in Unit 5; wired into the live path by
 * Unit 6 - reconcile_rule_locked() now calls GuardianSparkRuntime::attach_rule
 * (NonWaiting{}, ...), so ReconcileOutcome::Accepted is genuinely produced in
 * production (see that enum's own doc comment in guardian_engine.hpp).
 * apply_rules() begins/feeds an application, journal_maintenance_tick() drains
 * it every heartbeat, and the generation-hold gate reads can_advance() instead
 * of assuming pending_arms == 0.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative and pre-K-bound at rung 9c PR-2's own original
 * scope: a receipt that resolves to anything other than Committed held its
 * application's generation FOREVER, exactly like the pre-PR-2 synchronous
 * behavior - no wedge marking, no K-bound retry-then-waive. §R5.2's ClaimEnd
 * preserved the finer split a later rung 9c PR needed to implement that
 * (queue-wait expiry vs. dispatched timeout vs. genuine refusal); this
 * ledger did not need it and did not re-derive it here.
 *
 * As implemented (rung 9c PR-5e, #4221, K-bound closeout, decision 1): that
 * FOREVER hold now has exactly one carve-out, scoped narrowly to the Wedged
 * subset ClaimEnd's split makes expressible - see can_advance()'s own doc
 * comment and Application::reapply_count/failed_receipts for the mechanism.
 * A CongestionExpired/Withdrawn/Stopped/plain-Failed receipt, or a latched
 * application-level failure, still holds the generation forever exactly as
 * this paragraph originally described - K is a Wedged-only escape hatch, not
 * a change to that conservative default.
 *
 * One current application, never a history (Astra opine review: "New
 * application: stale receipts cannot acknowledge it"). begin_application()
 * unconditionally replaces whatever was there. A receipt from a superseded
 * application resolving later touches nothing - it is simply no longer in
 * any ledger's pending set. This is safe by construction, not by explicit
 * cancellation: an ArmReceipt is an OBSERVATION handle (its own doc comment)
 * and its KeyClaim is owned entirely by the runtime's own claims_ registry
 * either way - dropping the ledger's copy neither withdraws the rule nor
 * abandons the operation.
