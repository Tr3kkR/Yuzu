/**
 * subprocess_runner.cpp -- agent-core bounded, fork-safe subprocess runner
 * (#2273 foundation), extended to the full ADR-3002 runner contract
 * (docs/adr/3002-acquisition-ladder.md:537-606) plus the best-practice
 * addendum (A1-A6, B1-B6).
 *
 * Merges two independently hardened bounded-subprocess implementations that
 * grew up in different plugins for the same underlying problem (no
 * built-in timeout on `log show`, `codesign`, `plutil`, and GNU `timeout`
 * is not available on macOS): the event_logs plugin's line-collecting
 * bounded_run() and the filesystem plugin's exit-code/output-capturing
 * run_macos_tool(). Both forked+execed directly (no shell), killed the
 * child's whole process group on a deadline, and reaped it without leaving
 * a zombie behind -- this file is that logic, once, serving both
 * consumption styles (SubprocessResult carries both `lines` and `output`).
 *
 * Fork-safety notes (why the child branch looks the way it does):
 *   - The C-style argv/envp are built entirely in the PARENT, before fork().
 *     Between fork() and execve() the child may only call async-signal-safe
 *     functions (POSIX 2.4.3) -- allocating via std::vector/std::string
 *     post-fork is unsafe in a multithreaded process, since another thread
 *     can hold the allocator lock at the moment of fork, which the child
 *     inherits already-locked and then deadlocks on.
 *   - Both the output pipe and the exec-error pipe are FD_CLOEXEC on both
 *     ends, so neither leaks into whatever the child execs into.
 *   - Setting FD_CLOEXEC is NOT atomic with pipe() on this platform (no
 *     pipe2()) -- a concurrent fork() on another thread landing between
 *     THIS invocation's pipe() and its fcntl(F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC) would
 *     otherwise inherit a not-yet-CLOEXEC write end into an unrelated
 *     child, starving this invocation's own EOF (a false timeout) for as
 *     long as that other child runs. BR-001: the process-wide
 *     yuzu::agent::global_fork_lock() (fork_lock.hpp) serializes
 *     [pipe()..fork()] across every launcher that PARTICIPATES in it — this
 *     runner plus the sites listed in fork_lock.hpp's coverage ledger — to
 *     close that window; the child inherits it already locked and never
 *     touches it. It is NOT automatic for every fork/popen in the agent: a
 *     raw popen() that doesn't take the lock still races this window until it
 *     is migrated (fork_lock.hpp tracks the residual uncovered sites).
 *   - The child calls setsid() so a timeout kill can take out the whole
 *     process group, not just the direct child (a CLI can spawn helpers
 *     that inherit the group).
 *   - A second pipe (also FD_CLOEXEC) distinguishes "the exec itself
 *     failed" from "the program ran and legitimately exited with some
 *     code": on a successful execve() the write end's CLOEXEC flag closes
 *     it automatically, so the parent sees EOF with nothing ever written;
 *     on failure -- either execve() itself or a load-bearing setup step
 *     before it, e.g. the stdout dup2 -- the child write()s its errno to
 *     it (async-signal-safe, no allocation) before _exit(127).
 *
 * Pipe EOF alone does not prove the child has exited (a descendant can
 * close its inherited copy of the write end while the direct child keeps
 * running), so the run loop tracks child-reap state independently via
 * non-blocking waitpid()/wait4() polls and only finishes once the child is
 * confirmed dead (or the post-kill grace period elapses, whichever is
 * first).
 *
 * ADR-3002 additions on top of the shipped core above (none of which touch
 * the fd sweep, fork_lock, the hard deadline, process-group kill + reap, the
 * line/output caps, the exec-error pipe, or the single-pipe stderr design):
 *   - build_launch_spec() (subprocess_launch_spec.hpp) now does argv/env
 *     validation and assembly; the runtime argv[0]/embedded-NUL rejection
 *     that used to be assert-only now applies in every build type.
 *   - TerminationReason is computed and surfaced on every return path.
 *   - A per-invocation CancellationToken is checked alongside the existing
 *     process-global cancel flag.
 *   - A1-A6/B2-B6 (Windows handle allow-list + quoting, POSIX signal/rlimit/
 *     umask/env hardening, close_range/pidfd fast paths, rusage capture, the
 *     optional TOCTOU-safe exec primitive) are implemented as ADDITIONS
 *     around the shipped mechanisms, per the addendum's "extend around
 *     these; do not rewrite them."
 *   - A real Windows Job-Object backend replaces the previous stub.
