/**
 * guardian_spark_timing.hpp - #4606 criterion-10: plain-data timing record types +
 * their pure log-line formatters for the Spark detect->delivery latency benchmark
 * (T_ready -> T_mutation -> T_mechanism -> T_detect -> T_fire -> T_wire -> T_server ->
 * T_visible). T_ready and T_mutation are taken by the benchmark rig and T_visible is a
 * dashboard observation; none of the three is logged here, and T_mechanism, the handler
 * instant and T_fire are fields of the T_detect line, not lines of their own. Deliberately NOT
 * part of GuardianSparkRuntime's class interface:
 *   - so the format_*_line() functions are directly unit-testable (pure, no
 *     I/O, no clock reads) without touching the runtime;
 *   - so the agent-side send-site logging (agent.cpp, T_wire) can use
 *     SendTimingRecord/make_outbox_send_timing/format_send_timing_line without
 *     depending on guardian_spark_runtime.hpp (agent.cpp lives in this same
 *     directory and already avoids pulling that header in for an unrelated reason).
 *
 * Placed in agents/core/src/ (not agents/core/include/yuzu/agent/) so its
 * `#include "guardian_outbox.hpp"` (for OutboxDomain) resolves via ordinary
 * same-directory quoted-include lookup, matching guardian_spark_runtime.hpp's own
 * include of it - agents/core/src is not on yuzu_agent_core_lib's -I list, only
 * reachable via same-directory resolution, and neither is guardian_outbox.hpp
 * reachable from agents/core/include/yuzu/agent/ any other way.
 *
 * Field order/naming in both format_*_line() functions is the parseable-log-line
 * contract the benchmark tooling regexes against (same class of tooling as R5.7's
 * T0/T2 / the #3990 diagnostic) - keep it stable.
 *
 * CORRELATION CONTRACT (read before writing a correlator):
 *   - Join on the event id and the embedded wall-clock fields, NEVER on log-file line order.
 *     A T_wire line can precede its own T_detect line in the file: evaluate_key wakes the
 *     outbox drain worker BEFORE it emits the deferred T_detect line, so the enqueue and the
 *     wake never wait on the log sink, and two keys' deferred emissions can interleave. Treat
 *     the post-hoc join over the COMPLETE log as authoritative. A streaming correlator may
 *     buffer a T_wire for a grace window, but a stalled sink delays T_detect without bound,
 *     so expiry must file the sample in a "late" bucket and never drop it or count it as an
 *     orphan. In program order detect_wall_ns precedes wire_wall_ns for one event, but both
 *     are system_clock reads, so an NTP step can invert them; T_wire carries no *_mono_ns
 *     field.
 *   - Ordering and clocks. On the agent the program order is mechanism <= handler <= detect
 *     <= fire. fire <= wire and wire <= recv are NOT guaranteed: fire is stamped after the
 *     outbox lock is released, so a drain that is already running can send and stamp wire
 *     first, and wire is stamped after Write() returns, by which time the server may already
 *     have logged receipt. Small negative deltas between those pairs are ordinary. Every
 *     *_wall_ns field, and recv_ns, committed_ns and agent_ns, is a wall-clock read, so any
 *     difference taken between two hosts (agent_ns, the wire->recv hop and the gateway hop
 *     between them) includes their clock skew; the *_mono_ns fields are for intervals within
 *     one process only.
 *   - The lines are written synchronously. T_detect: on the thread that ran the evaluation
 *     (the Spark consumer thread for an Event pass; a convergence lane or the priority thread
 *     otherwise). T_wire: on the detached send worker of its lane (Spark path: the lifecycle
 *     lane and the compliance+health lane each have a single-flight executor) or on the guard
 *     worker (legacy path). T_server: on the thread that reads the agent's Subscribe stream
 *     (direct path, where it is the whole read loop, so a stall also delays that agent's
 *     other responses) or on the server's ForwardGuardianMessage handler when the agent is
 *     behind a gateway. A log sink that blocks therefore stalls whichever of those is
 *     writing: Event evaluations queued behind it, a convergence sweep, the next send on that
 *     lane, or the next ingest. Removing the Spark-path coupling
 *     is a flip precondition (docs/spark-flip-gate.md section 7).
 *   - The agent-side lines carry no agent field (each agent has its own log); join on
 *     (agent, event_id), taking the agent from the log's origin and from T_server's agent=.
 *   - Event id layout differs by path. Spark: `<agent>-<boot_nonce>-<rule>-<wall_ms>-<seq>`,
 *     where a new agent process gets a new boot_nonce, so an id minted before a restart is
 *     never re-minted after it. Legacy (domain=legacy): `<rule>-<agent>-<wall_ms>-<seq>`,
 *     with NO boot_nonce and a per-process seq. An empty agent id (before registration) is
 *     a known degenerate case.
 *   - The event id (and T_server's agent and rule ids) is untrusted text: it embeds the
 *     operator-authored rule id. It goes through ONE shared function (yuzu::log_id_token,
 *     common/include/yuzu/log_token.hpp) on both sides: every byte outside printable ASCII,
 *     and space, '=' and ',', becomes '_', and an id longer than 256 bytes is shortened to
 *     exactly 256 as <head> '~' <last 24 bytes>, which keeps the `<wall_ms>-<seq>` tail that
 *     tells two events of one rule apart. So an id with such characters, or of any length,
 *     still joins. Two different raw ids CAN share one logged token: when they differ solely
 *     in neutralised characters, when they are over-long and share both their head and their
 *     last 24 bytes, or (since '~' is an ordinary character) when a raw 256-byte id equals the
 *     shortened form of a longer one. The server's Redelivered, Conflict and Error lines use
 *     the same function.
 *   - Every T_* line is best-effort, so "no partner" is evidence, not proof: a line can be
 *     missing because the log call failed (the error is swallowed), the level was raised
 *     above info at run time, a file rotated, or the process stopped between the write and
 *     the log call.
 *   - Reading a T_detect line that has no later lines:
 *       accepted=0 (fire_*_ns=-1)  the outbox rejected the batch; nothing was enqueued. The
 *                                  next eval pass mints a NEW event_id (and logs another
 *                                  accepted=0 line for as long as the outbox stays full).
 *       accepted=1, no T_wire      enqueued but never sent: coalesced away (a later
 *                                  observation for the same rule+domain replaced it under a
 *                                  newer event_id, same boot_nonce), purged (generation
 *                                  superseded, or the rule was dropped), still queued
 *                                  (including behind a slow or blocked send), held back by a
 *                                  down stream (the Spark path logs no T_wire for that), or
 *                                  the agent stopped first. The T_* lines alone cannot tell
 *                                  the last four apart (other agent log lines, such as arm
 *                                  and lifecycle messages, can help). The Compliance/Health
 *                                  outbox is an in-memory buffer, NOT durable
 *                                  (guardian_outbox.hpp): after a restart the boot
 *                                  re-evaluation MAY mint a fresh id under a new boot_nonce
 *                                  (only if the re-evaluation emits).
 *   - trigger_present=1 means a detection event started the pass. The trigger fields
 *     describe THAT event and are repeated on every entry the pass stages, including an entry
 *     for a rule the event did not change (a refresh or a first verdict), so a trigger_present=1
 *     line is not by itself a detection of its own rule. trigger_present=0 (a scheduled
 *     re-evaluation) carries -1 in all four trigger fields.
 *   - Reading a T_wire line:
 *       Spark path (domain=compliance|health|lifecycle):
 *         sent=0  Write() returned false. The entry is retained and re-sent under the SAME
 *                 event_id unless it is coalesced or dropped in the meantime, in which case
 *                 that id never gets a sent=1. A DOWN stream logs no T_wire line at all.
 *         sent=1  the local write succeeded, which is NOT receipt. A retried send produces
 *                 several T_wire lines for one event_id.
 *       domain=legacy (the non-Spark drift-sink path: no outbox, no T_detect):
 *         sent=0  the event was DROPPED (link down or Write() failed). There is no retry.
 *                 A legacy detection made before the sink is wired is dropped with NO line
 *                 at all, so the absence of a legacy T_wire does not prove nothing fired.
 *   - A T_wire line with no T_detect is normal, not an orphan: domain=lifecycle (armed,
 *     disarmed and errored events - a subscription LOSS produces a lifecycle "errored"
 *     entry - and journal replays from this or an earlier process), domain=health raised by
 *     a subscription FAULT or its recovery rather than an evaluation pass, and
 *     domain=legacy. It can also mean the agent stopped between the waker and the deferred
 *     T_detect line.
 *   - T_server (server log) fields: recv_ns and committed_ns are wall-clock instants on the
 *     SERVER; agent_ns is the event's own AGENT-side timestamp (on the Spark path the outbox
 *     entry's enqueue stamp; whole seconds on the legacy path), so arithmetic between
 *     agent_ns and the server's instants includes any agent/server clock skew; store_ms is
 *     the elapsed time of the whole store call, including work after the commit, so it is
 *     not committed_ns - recv_ns; agent_ns=-1 marks an ABSENT or invalid wire timestamp. It
 *     is emitted for Inserted only. Redelivered is logged at debug, Conflict and Error at
 *     warn (the Conflict warning carries event_id; the Error warning and the parse-failure
 *     warning do not, so they cannot be joined), so at the default info level a replay and a
 *     loss look alike in the server log: T_wire sent=1 with no T_server means lost in
 *     flight, OR classified Redelivered, Conflict or Error, OR the server had no Guardian
 *     store configured (on the direct path it then skips the store without any line; the
 *     gateway path logs a warning that carries no event_id). A T_server with no T_wire means
 *     the agent's line was not written or not retained (see best-effort above).
