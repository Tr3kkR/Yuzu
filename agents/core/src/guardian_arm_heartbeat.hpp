/// flagged not specified" paragraph; ~/.claude/plans/spark-rung9c-pr3-telemetry-
/// KICKOFF-v2.md Decision 1). Mirrors guardian_journal_heartbeat.hpp's AGE-gauge
/// pattern (emit_guardian_journal_age_tags), NOT its sparse-counter pattern: these
/// are RE-STATABLE GAUGES, not monotonic per-sweep counters rolled up into a fleet
/// sum. A nearby row in docs/spark-legacy-delta-registry.md (the counter-rollup
/// families) uses the opposite shape - copying that by analogy would silently break
/// the K-bound safety argument the whole mechanism rests on, since a cleared
/// quarantine (PR-5) would never be reflected by a monotonic counter.

/// GuardianArmStats is assembled by GuardianEngine::arm_stats() from
/// GuardianArmAckLedger::arm_stats() (agents/core/src/guardian_arm_ack.hpp) - the
/// CURRENT application's still-pending accepted-arm count and resolved-failure
/// count. Both fields describe the SAME application snapshot, sampled together
/// under GuardianEngine::mtx_, so the pair is internally consistent within one
/// sample (unlike the generation tag read separately elsewhere on the heartbeat -
/// see GuardianEngine::arm_stats()'s own doc comment).

    /// increments it) - but it already resets to 0 whenever decide_retry() returns
    /// Reapply on a generation that previously failed, which begins a FRESH
    /// application via begin_application(). That Reapply path is driven by the
    /// existing ~25s full_sync retry cadence and is live TODAY, independent of PR-5.
    /// So: "decreases on application replacement, which already happens on an
    /// ordinary retry of a generation that saw a failure" - NOT "monotonic until

/// false, the engine stopped, Spark itself unavailable (Unwired/SparkFailed/
/// SparkDisabled), or the ledger has no current application yet. THIS explicit
/// four-way gate is load-
/// bearing (Check A, KICKOFF-v2): GuardianEngine::apply_rules() calls
/// GuardianArmAckLedger::begin_application() UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of

/// "spark dormant" from "spark live, currently clean" - a legacy (non-spark) agent
/// has a live, empty Application on every push. Gating on `current_ != nullptr`
/// alone would read as false-present-healthy ("arm_pending=0, arm_failed=0") on
/// every non-spark agent in the fleet. See GuardianEngine::arm_stats()'s own doc
/// comment for where that gate actually lives.
///
/// A live snapshot emits BOTH keys, including a genuine zero: a rule genuinely at
/// zero pending/failed must read as "checked, healthy", not "dormant" - an omitted
/// tag reads as dormant to a fleet-level consumer, exactly the distinction the
