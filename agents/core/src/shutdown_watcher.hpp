/// @file shutdown_watcher.hpp
/// The agent's POSIX shutdown self-pipe: a signal handler writes ONE byte; a dedicated
/// watcher thread wakes and runs the real teardown.
///
/// WHY IT IS IN A HEADER, not buried in main.cpp. An earlier version of this lived in
/// main.cpp, so the unit test could only RE-IMPLEMENT the pipe ("build it the same way the
/// watcher does") and pin a COPY. That copy passed while the real code was broken: the real
/// `pipe2()` call carried `O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK`, which sets O_NONBLOCK on BOTH ends, so
/// the watcher's blocking read() returned EAGAIN, the thread exited within microseconds, and
/// SIGTERM silently stopped triggering a graceful stop. Nothing looked broken — the process
/// still died via the default disposition. Testing a copy is not testing.
/// (governance Gate-8 cpp-safety.)
///
/// ── WHY THE SELF-PIPE EXISTS AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────
/// The handler used to call `Agent::stop()` inline. stop() takes mutexes, joins worker
/// threads, calls sd_bus_unref (malloc/free) and logs through spdlog — none of which may run
/// in a signal handler. And a process-directed signal lands on an ARBITRARY unmasked thread,
/// so if it landed on a thread stop() JOINS, that join was a SELF-JOIN: std::system_error
/// out of a `noexcept` function -> std::terminate, on SIGTERM. Moving the teardown onto an
/// ordinary thread — one stop() never joins — makes the whole class structurally impossible,
/// and is what let SparkEngine delete its entire signal-mitigation layer.
///
/// ── SIX TRAPS. All hit for real. Do not "simplify" past them. ──
///   1. A bare joinable std::thread in main's scope: `agent->run()` is NOT wrapped in a try
///      at its call site, so a throw unwinds past it -> ~std::thread on a joinable thread ->
///      std::terminate. Hence RAII, declared AFTER the Agent so it is destroyed FIRST.
///   2. A throw from the CONSTRUCTOR BODY skips the destructor. std::thread's ctor throws
///      std::system_error under EAGAIN — on exactly the thread-exhausted host this is meant
///      to survive. RAII does not save you; the ctor must clean up by hand.
///   3. `pipe2(fds, O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK)` sets O_NONBLOCK on BOTH ends, so the watcher's
///      read() returns EAGAIN immediately and it exits at once. O_NONBLOCK belongs on the
///      WRITE end ONLY (so the handler can never block); the READ end must BLOCK.
///   4. Without O_CLOEXEC both fds are inherited by every popen()/fork+exec child — the
///      trigger engine plus the ioc / firewall / services / software_actions / wol /
///      license_scan plugins — handing every subprocess a lever to shut the agent down.
///   5. Closing the read end while the write end lives makes any late write raise SIGPIPE,
///      whose disposition here is SIG_DFL: it KILLS the agent (exit 141). The fds are never
///      closed; two held to process exit is the correct trade.
///   6. `ok()` MUST test liveness, never `joinable()` — which stays TRUE for a FINISHED thread.
///      If the watcher died on a read() error, a joinable()-based ok() went on reporting true,
///      the handlers stayed installed, and every later SIGTERM was written into a pipe with NO
///      READER: swallowed. The agent became UNKILLABLE by SIGTERM. Hence `alive_`, plus the
///      `on_watcher_died` callback that hands the signals back to the kernel (SIG_DFL).
///
/// AND: nothing may throw out of the CONSTRUCTOR BODY (trap 2) — including a LOG. spdlog
/// rethrows non-std exceptions, so every failure-path log goes through log_quietly()'s
/// try/catch firewall. thread_pool.hpp carries the same firewall for the same reason.
///
/// AND: if construction fails, `ok()` is false and the caller MUST NOT install the signal
/// handlers — otherwise the handler catches the signal, finds no pipe, returns, and the
/// signal is SWALLOWED with no default disposition left, so SIGTERM stops working entirely.
///
/// ── THE SECOND-SIGNAL ESCALATION IS AN INTERACTIVE-OPERATOR FEATURE ONLY. ────────
/// It is NOT the production mitigation, and must never be relied on as one: systemd and
/// `docker stop` each send exactly ONE SIGTERM and then SIGKILL. No supervisor ever sends a
/// second. The OTA self-stop path (the update thread calls Agent::stop() itself) gets no
/// signal at all and no supervisor timeout, because nobody asked us to stop.
/// SO THERE IS NO INTERNAL BOUND ON A WEDGED STOP, AND THIS PR DOES NOT ADD ONE. Say it plainly
/// rather than gesture at machinery that is not here: stop() drains guardian_/dex_observer_ with
/// an UNBOUNDED wait, and the only thing that ends a wedged teardown is the supervisor's SIGKILL
/// (and on the OTA self-stop path, nothing at all). An internal deadline is the right answer and
/// is being built separately — it failed review three times because it was designed against an
/// IDLE agent, and a running command holds a worker that nothing can cancel across the plugin ABI.
/// Do not write a comment here claiming a bound exists until one does.
