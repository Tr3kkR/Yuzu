/**
 * dex_perf_breach.hpp — sustained performance-breach detection (BRD A3,
 * docs/dex-brd-coverage.md rows 13–15, 124).
 *
 * The A1 TAR perf warehouse is HISTORY (every 30 s sample, on-device, raw-SQL
 * queryable); this module is ALERTS: the Windows state poller samples a minimal
 * counter set on a slow cadence and emits a ruleless DEX observation when a
 * metric stays bad for a sustained window — `perf.cpu_sustained`,
 * `perf.memory_pressure`, `perf.disk_latency_high`. Detection lives here in
 * agent core, NOT the TAR plugin: plugins have no path to the Guardian
 * observation sink, and sustained-condition semantics are exactly the
 * dex_win_poll poll-and-latch shape (see memory project-dex-brd-delivery).
 *
 * Emission is bounded by construction, no rate cap needed: a breach needs
 * `sustain` consecutive bad samples to fire once, then re-arms only after
 * `recover` consecutive VALID samples below the EXIT threshold (hysteresis —
 * a metric flapping at the enter threshold cannot re-fire), so the worst case
 * is one observation per type per (sustain + recover) samples (~4/h/type at
 * the 120 s cadence). Thresholds are hardcoded sane defaults until F1 makes
 * them operator-tunable (the D3 blast-radius precedent).
 *
 * The counter derivations mirror tar_perf.cpp (the A1 reference
 * implementation) but read only the three breach metrics; the two stay
 * separate because agent core must not compile plugin sources. Pure functions
 * compile and unit-test on every host; the Win32 reads (GetSystemTimes,
 * GetPerformanceInfo, IOCTL_DISK_PERFORMANCE — no PDH, no WMI, no shell-out)
 * live behind read_perf_breach_counters() in the _WIN32 section of the .cpp.
 * windows.h-free and proto-free by design (the dex_observer.hpp rationale).
