/**
 * guardian_outbox.hpp - the Guardian spark consumer's in-memory, lifetime-safe
 * emit buffer (ADR-0021 Stage 2 rung 2). PURE and caller-serialized: no I/O, no
 * threads, no clock, no proto. The runtime drives it under its registry mutex and
 * injects a send function at drain time, so every branch is unit-tested standalone.
 *
 * Why it exists (the pre-network / A3 gap it closes): GuardianEngine arms and does
 * its initial eval BEFORE the server sink is published (start_local runs before
 * Subscribe-open). Emitting straight to the sink there DROPS the event, yet
 * decide_emit has already committed last_compliant - so the compliant edge is lost
 * forever and steady-compliant stays silent, and the server never learns
 * compliance. The consumer instead enqueues here and drains when the sink is live.
 * This is an in-memory buffer plus a boot re-eval, NOT durable event delivery: a
 * process restart re-arms and re-evaluates from scratch rather than replaying.
 *
 * Contract the runtime MUST honour (enforced structurally here where possible):
 *   - enqueue BEFORE commit. Run the eval against a COPY of RuleEvalState, enqueue
 *     the outcome, and commit the copy back ONLY if enqueue() returned true. If it
 *     returned false (at cap), discard the copy so the eval stays pending and
 *     convergence retries - never advance decider state for an event we could not
 *     buffer. (decide_emit mutates state mid-eval, hence copy-eval-enqueue-commit.)
 *   - peek / send / remove-on-success. drain() sends in FIFO order and removes an
 *     entry only when the send reports success; a false return OR a throw retains
 *     the entry and STOPS the drain (the stream is down - do not burn N syscalls).
 *   - SEPARATE coalescing domains. compliance / health each coalesce to the latest
 *     per rule independently; a health event never overwrites a pending compliance
 *     event for the same rule. Lifecycle is NOT a domain this class accepts - see
 *     GuardianLifecycleLog below and enqueue()'s rejection of it.
 *   - generation-tagged, purged on rule update/disable. A stale entry from a
 *     superseded generation is dropped, never sent.
 *   - event_id + timestamp fixed at ENQUEUE (the caller sets them; this stays free
 *     of clock/randomness). Coalescing replaces with the latest observation's id+ts.
 *   - full-cap => reject (caller leaves the eval pending) + bump the backpressure
 *     counter. NEVER silently evict a buffered entry to make room.
 *
 * The drain trigger (sink publication + every reconnect, not sync_with_server) and
 * the boot re-arm/re-eval are the runtime's wiring, not this structure's concern.
