/// The `device_ci` daily-sync source (ADR-0016) — a further source of the agent
/// sync framework (after `installed_software` and `app_perf`). Collects the
/// machine's stable hardware / OS identity — a ServiceNow-CMDB-style configuration
/// item (CI) record — by invoking the existing `hardware`, `device_identity`,
/// `os_info`, and `network_config` plugins in-process (`LocalDispatcher`) and
/// rendering them into the canonical wire blob the server (`device_ci_ingestion`)
/// reconstructs byte-for-byte.
///
/// **Machine scope only** — no per-user data (ADR-0016 §8). **Deliberately excludes
/// volatile telemetry** (disk free space, uptime, IP addresses): those flap between
/// cycles, which would flip the content hash every sync and defeat the hash-skip
/// protocol (the network-kindness the framework exists for). Only stable identity /
/// firmware / fixed-hardware / OS-version facts are in the CI record.
