/**
 * guardian_spark_backend.hpp - binds GuardianSparkRuntime's abstract
 * ISparkBackend to the real SparkEngine (ADR-0021 Stage 2 rung 7).
 *
 * BREAKS A CONSTRUCTION CYCLE: GuardianSparkRuntime needs an ISparkBackend at
 * construction; this adapter needs a SparkEngine::ConsumerId to forward
 * arm()/disarm() to; the ConsumerId comes from SparkEngine::register_consumer(),
 * whose handler argument is GuardianSparkRuntime::make_handler(shared_ptr<
 * GuardianSparkRuntime>) - which needs the runtime to ALREADY exist. Two-phase
 * construction breaks it: build the adapter UNBOUND, build the runtime around
 * it, register the consumer (now possible - the runtime exists), THEN
 * bind_consumer() with the real id. No caller can reach attach_rule() (and
 * therefore arm()) before the whole wiring sequence - owned by
 * GuardianEngine::wire_spark_engine() - returns, so an unbound arm() call is
 * unreachable in production; it is guarded here anyway with a typed error
 * rather than silently forwarding a sentinel ConsumerId (SparkEngine's own
 * arm() would itself reject an unregistered id with "unknown consumer id", but
 * that reads as a mystery bug rather than a caller-sequencing one).
 *
 * LIFETIME: engine_ is BORROWED, never owned. This is safe ONLY because of
 * agent.cpp's member declaration order: spark_engine_ is declared BEFORE
 * guardian_ (which owns this adapter, transitively via GuardianSparkRuntime's
 * shared_ptr<ISparkBackend>). Members destroy in REVERSE declaration order -
 * the LAST-declared member is destroyed FIRST - so guardian_ (declared later)
 * is destroyed BEFORE spark_engine_ (declared earlier): spark_engine_ always
 * outlives this adapter's lifetime. (Landed as a governance Gate 2/3 fix, this
 * PR - a first attempt at this fix got the declaration order BACKWARDS
 * [guardian_ before spark_engine_, which destroys spark_engine_ first - the
 * exact bug being fixed], caught by an independent Gate 8 re-review and
 * verified empirically with a standalone destructor-order reproducer before
 * landing this corrected version. Do not reorder agent.cpp's guardian_/
 * spark_engine_ declarations without re-verifying this invariant the same
 * way - prose review alone was not enough to catch the inversion.)
