/**
 * guardian_rule_eval.hpp - the per-type Guardian rule evaluators for the spark
 * consumer (ADR-0021 Stage 2 rung 2).
 *
 * Each evaluator takes a rule's proto-free assertion, a tri-state live-state
 * READ (Known snapshot | Unknown read-error), and the rule's mutable eval
 * state, and returns an EvalOutcome the runtime acts on:
 *
 *   - Emit      -> a GuardDrift (a compliant edge OR a drift) to publish, packed
 *                  with the legacy detected/expected token vocabulary so
 *                  GuardianEngine::emit_guard_event produces the SAME wire event
 *                  as the legacy guards (the parity gate).
 *   - Silent    -> steady compliant / debounce-suppressed drift: nothing to emit.
 *   - Unhealthy -> the read was Unknown (could not determine live state). The
 *                  evaluator leaves EmitDeciderState UNTOUCHED - it does NOT turn
 *                  "can't tell" into a false compliant/drift - and hands back the
 *                  read-error detail. Emitting guard.unhealthy (edge-triggered +
 *                  rate-limited) and mapping status -> errored is the runtime's
 *                  job (a later rung); here we only refuse to commit a verdict.
 *
 * Unknown is distinct from a legitimately-absent target (a missing file / deleted
 * service is a Known snapshot that drifts). It is reserved for "could not tell":
 * a transient I/O error, or a file that mutated during hashing past the reader's
 * bounded retry. On recovery (the first Known read after an Unknown), the
 * evaluator FORCES a real verdict even when the value equals its pre-error value,
 * so the server re-learns compliance after an errored gap (see `pack`).
 *
 * Proto-free (operates on RuleAssertion, extracted from the rule at arm time by
 * GuardianEngine) and platform-agnostic (the platform I/O that produces the read
 * lives in the StateReader seam, not here), so every branch is unit-tested
 * off-platform against synthetic reads.
