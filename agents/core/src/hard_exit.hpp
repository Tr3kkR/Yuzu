/// The single shared "leave now, no unwinding" primitive (ADR-0021 rung 7.6,
/// the F3 orphan-exit obligation - see guardian_io_executor.hpp's "ORPHAN
/// PROCESS-EXIT CONTRACT"). main.cpp's signal handlers already needed this
/// exact `#ifdef _WIN32 TerminateProcess #else _exit #endif` pattern twice
/// before this file existed; extracted here so a third call site (the F3
/// orphan-worker check) doesn't duplicate it a third time, and so
/// service_win.cpp's SCM path can share it too.
///
/// WHY TerminateProcess, NOT ::_exit(), ON WINDOWS: ::_exit() routes through
/// ExitProcess, which runs DLL_PROCESS_DETACH for every loaded plugin DLL -
/// taking the loader lock a wedged thread may already hold. TerminateProcess
/// runs no DllMain and takes no loader lock.
///
/// WHY ::_exit(), NOT std::exit(), ON POSIX: exit_group(2) is async-signal-
/// safe - no atexit handlers, no static/DSO destructors, cannot block. That
/// is the entire point: a caller reaching for hard_exit() has already decided
/// normal C++ teardown is not safe to run (a wedged shutdown, or - F3 - a
/// detached Guardian I/O worker that may still be executing library code
/// through it).
