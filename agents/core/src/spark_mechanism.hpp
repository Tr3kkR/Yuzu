/**
 * spark_mechanism.hpp — the injectable watch-mechanism seam for event-driven
 * spark types (ADR-0021 Stage 1 PR 1b).
 *
 * Interval / Startup / Disk are timer-driven and serviced by the SparkEngine's
 * wheel (spark_engine.cpp). File / Registry / Service are EVENT-driven: they do
 * not sit on the wheel — a kernel notification, not a deadline, is the trigger.
 * Each such type is serviced by one `ISparkMechanism` that multiplexes EVERY
 * armed spark of its type onto O(mechanism) OS resources — one IOCP + thread
 * for file changes, one TP_WAIT pool for registry changes, one sd-bus
 * connection + thread (Linux) or one alertable-wait thread + one SCM
 * connection (Windows) for service changes — never O(rules).
 *
 * The seam is what keeps this PR testable off Windows: the real IOCP / TP_WAIT
 * impls are Windows-only (spark_file.cpp / spark_registry.cpp), but a test
 * fake wired via SparkEngine::register_mechanism() exercises the whole
 * arm / dedup / fan-out / disarm-teardown path on any platform (the
 * DiskReaderFn seam precedent, generalised to a stateful, thread-owning
 * mechanism — the tar ProcStreamCollector shape). Service (spark_service.cpp,
 * Stage-1 PR 1c) is the first mechanism real on TWO platforms at once (Linux
 * sd-bus + Windows SCM) rather than Windows-only.
 *
 * Platform contract (why arm() rejects rather than succeeds-inert off Windows):
 * `make_file_mechanism()` / `make_registry_mechanism()` return a real
 * mechanism on Windows and `nullptr` elsewhere; `make_service_mechanism()`
 * returns a real mechanism on Windows AND on Linux built with libsystemd
 * (`-DYUZU_HAVE_LIBSYSTEMD`, gated by the `systemd_guard` meson feature option
 * — the same option that gates guard_systemd.cpp), `nullptr` on macOS or a
 * Linux build without libsystemd. A SparkEngine with no mechanism for a type
 * REJECTS arm() of that type — preserving the spark.hpp invariant "Armed means
 * the engine is running a watcher for the spec" (a succeed-but-inert arm would
 * be armed with no watcher). This mirrors the guard_file / guard_registry /
 * guard_systemd precedent (no-op off-platform → never reads as armed). The
 * "Linux agent receives a cross-platform Baseline containing a file guard" UX
 * is Guardian's concern (Stage 2), not the detection primitive's.

///      watch()/unwatch() were already O(1) queue pushes, and the SCM
///      establishment call (OpenServiceW) now runs on a bounded, F3-counted
///      probe lane rather than head-of-line on the mechanism's one thread.
///   2. A mechanism must NEVER call emit()/fault() synchronously from inside
///      watch()/unwatch() - not even on an immediate-success path. The engine's
///      per-type lock is on that call stack, and an Inline consumer reacting by
///      re-arming the same type would self-deadlock the non-recursive lock.
