/**
 * dex_linux_journal.hpp — pure journald-record classification for Linux DEX.
 *
 * The Linux DEX collector (dex_linux_collector.cpp) reads the systemd journal via
 * a slow-cadence `journalctl --after-cursor … -o json` shell-out (the macOS
 * `log show` playbook — the DEX family reads logs via the OS log CLI), and feeds
 * each line through the PURE classifier here. journald reliability events map onto
 * EXISTING obs_types, so a Linux server lights up the same `/dex` buckets as
 * Windows/macOS with ZERO server change:
 *   - systemd unit failed     (MESSAGE_ID "Failed with result", live carrier;     → service.crashed
 *                              SD_MESSAGE_UNIT_FAILED also matched, defensive)
 *   - systemd-coredump entry  (MESSAGE_ID SD_MESSAGE_COREDUMP)                     → process.crashed
 *   - kernel OOM-killer       (_TRANSPORT=kernel + the OOM text)                   → memory.exhausted
 *
 * A unit failure is service.crashed whether it died at runtime or failed to start —
 * the two are indistinguishable by MESSAGE_ID (see parse_journal_line for why the
 * service.start_failed split is not done).
 *
 * journalctl shell-out, not sd-journal, deliberately: no libsystemd build dep (the
 * collector stays buildable on musl/Alpine like the PR3 /proc source), no coupling
 * to the systemd_guard feature-gate, and `journalctl -o json` → a pure classifier
 * keeps the off-Linux-tested pattern (this file). MESSAGE_ID matching gives one
 * canonical entry per failure (so no multi-line de-dup needed); a flapping unit is
 * bounded by the collector's per-(type,subject) debounce, not here.
 *
 * PRIVACY (works-council / co-determination): only safe fields leave the device —
 * the killed/failed process comm, the unit name, and the signal/result code. The
 * raw MESSAGE is never shipped (the kernel OOM line is read only to extract the
 * killed comm). Never throws (the JSON parse is exception-free).
