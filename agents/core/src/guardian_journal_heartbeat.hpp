/// @file guardian_journal_heartbeat.hpp
/// Writer side of the durable lifecycle-audit journal's fleet telemetry (item 7 PR-Ag,
/// design §8). Extracted from the agent heartbeat lambda so the exact emitted keys + the
/// sparse-emit rule are unit-testable without a heartbeat thread. Mirrors
/// spark_heartbeat.hpp; the keys are pinned to the server-side reader by a unit test.
///
/// SPARSE: every field is a counter (or a depth gauge) that is 0 on a healthy, quiescent,
/// or inert (prefer_spark=false) agent, so a tag is emitted ONLY when non-zero. A journal
/// that has never dropped/failed/quarantined/paged anything ships NO journal tags at all -
/// fleet-kind, and it keeps the "absent == nothing to report" reading honest.
