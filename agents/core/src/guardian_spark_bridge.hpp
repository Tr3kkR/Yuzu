/**
 * guardian_spark_bridge.hpp - the Guardian-rule <-> spark vocabulary bridge
 * (ADR-0021 Stage 2 rung 2 slice 2b, extended rung 7). Converts a
 * GuaranteedStateRule's typed blocks into the SparkSpec the SparkEngine arms,
 * and classifies a rule's spark type against this host's mechanism capability.
 *
 * Source-of-truth note: the spark block carries only the type discriminator
 * ("file-change" / "service-status-change" / "registry-change"); the watch
 * TARGET (path / service_name / hive+key) lives in the ASSERTION params. This
 * mirrors exactly how the legacy guards read it in
 * start_guard_for_rule_locked() (guardian_engine.cpp) - the two paths must
 * resolve the same target or a rule would watch one thing and assert over
 * another.
 *
 * SINGLE-SOURCED token recognition (rung 7 fix): spark_type_from_token() is the
 * ONE place the three recognized spark-type strings are listed. Both
 * spark_spec_from_rule() and classify() call it, so they cannot silently drift
 * apart (previously each had its own separate copy of the same three strings -
 * an agreement that held by coincidence, not by construction). A caller that
 * already has a spark_spec_from_rule() Some result never needs classify()'s
 * Unrecognized branch - Some already proves the token was recognized - so
 * classify() exists for the cases that still need the FULL three-way split
 * (platform-capability decisions made independently of building a SparkSpec),
 * and its own unit tests document the taxonomy.
 *
 * INLINE by design (not a .cpp in the DLL): a proto Map<string,string> lookup
 * must run in the SAME image that populated the map, or it hits the #501
 * abseil-seed-across-DLL hash mismatch on MSVC debug (see
 * guardian_engine.hpp's guardian_dispatch_push_bytes_for_test rationale). Inline
 * keeps populate+find co-located - the DLL both parses the wire rule and calls
 * this; a unit test both builds the rule and calls this - so neither crosses the
 * boundary. classify() and spark_type_from_token() touch no proto Map, so this
 * constraint doesn't strictly apply to them, but they stay in this header
 * (still inline, still trivial) rather than splitting into a second file for
 * two small pure functions.
 *
 * rule_assertion_from_rule() (rung 7) is the RuleAssertion-side counterpart to
 * spark_spec_from_rule(): together they give the reconcile op everything
 * attach_rule() needs, having faithfully re-derived the SAME normalization the
 * legacy start_guard_for_rule_locked() (guardian_engine.cpp) already applies -
 * hash lowercasing, whole-string max_bytes parsing + zero-normalization, the
 * file-exists/absent default, and the debounce window sourced from
 * parse_resilience_params over the remediation block. It does NOT carry the
 * watch TARGET (that is spark_spec_from_rule's job) or an enforce/remediation
 * mode - the spark evaluators are detection-only through this rung (rung 3 is
 * when spark gains enforcement), so RuleAssertion has no field for it yet.
 * `settle_ms` (file-hash-equals' mid-write notification coalescing window) is a
 * FileGuard-mechanism-level concern with no RuleAssertion field and no spark
 * FileSparkParams equivalent - an ACCEPTED behavioral delta from legacy
 * (spark's convergence scheduler dead-reckons via size+mtime skip + a forced
 * periodic re-hash instead of debouncing kernel notifications), flagged here
 * for the rung-9 design-doc rewrite and the rung-10 parity/durability matrix.
