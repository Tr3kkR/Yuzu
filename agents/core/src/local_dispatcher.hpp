/**
 * local_dispatcher.hpp — agent-side in-process plugin dispatch.
 *
 * #1001 / arch-S3: PR 10 introduced an agent snapshot pump that needs
 * to invoke `tar.fleet_snapshot` locally and harvest its JSON payload
 * without touching the gRPC channel. The first implementation hand-wired
 * a `capture` pointer onto CommandContextImpl and branched
 * `flush_output_locked` on `capture != nullptr` to avoid null-deref on
 * `stream`. That smuggled two modes into a struct meant for one (the
 * gRPC streaming path) and bled into every future feature that needed
 * local-dispatch (periodic Guardian rule eval, agent-side health probes,
 * etc.) — the next adopter would copy the pattern and accrete another
 * mode-branch.
 *
 * LocalDispatcher is the single entry point for "run a plugin action
 * in-process and give me back its output". Callers shrink to a few
 * lines (cycle, log, ship to heartbeat). The capture buffer cap and
 * the truncation sentinel live here, not in CommandContextImpl.
 *
 * The cap matches the server-side `FleetTopologyStore::kPushedSnapshotMaxBytes`
 * (2 MiB). Snapshots above the cap are truncated with a sentinel suffix
 * so the server-side parser cleanly rejects the payload rather than
 * ingesting a half-finished structure; the dispatcher signals the
 * truncation through the `truncated` field on the result.
 *
 * BR-001 (Wave 5 PR5.1 whole-branch review): `result_status`/
 * `result_completeness`/`result_provenance` surface whatever the plugin
 * reported via `CommandContext::set_result_status()` (the ABI4 CC-07
 * result-status seam, `yuzu_ctx_set_result_status`), read back from the
 * SAME `CommandContextImpl` `dispatch_with_capture` already constructs --
 * same shape as `truncated` above, not a second dispatch mechanism. Added
 * so a unit test can prove a migrated plugin's `forward_runner_failure`
 * call (runner_status.hpp) actually reaches the host seam, not just that
 * the call site exists.
