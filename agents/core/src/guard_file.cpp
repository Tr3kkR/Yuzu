/**
 * guard_file.cpp — see guard_file.hpp.
 *
 * Windows: one watch thread holds a wait set of {dir-change, ancestor-change,
 * parent-change, stop} and runs reconcile() on every wakeup. reconcile() re-resolves from
 * scratch — if the parent directory exists, arm ReadDirectoryChangesW on it and
 * re-check the target's presence; else walk up to the nearest existing ancestor
 * and watch it for the parent's (re)creation. Arming happens BEFORE the presence
 * check so a change in the arm→check gap re-fires. This makes the guard resilient
 * (design §24): it survives the parent dir — and its whole ancestor chain — being
 * deleted and recreated, and keeps detecting until stop().
 *
 * Only changes to OUR filename (parsed from the FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION records)
 * trigger a reconcile, so a busy sibling-heavy directory does not wake us
 * needlessly (network-kindness / NFR). A buffer overflow (bytesReturned == 0)
 * reconciles unconditionally — we can't know what changed.
 *
 * The armed directory X (the target's parent, or the nearest existing ancestor) is
 * opened with FILE_SHARE_DELETE, so renaming or moving X gives no completion on X's
 * own handle: the handle follows X to its new name. A second, non-recursive
 * directory-name-only read on X's parent P reports that rename; a record naming X (or
 * carrying X's file id) or an overflow re-runs the same reconcile. P is bound to X's
 * resolved path and RETAINED across ordinary re-arms (run()'s `bind()`, the three-arm
 * rule in its own comment) — it is rebuilt only when X's identity actually changes, and
 * a rebuild is still armed before X is reopened, so a rename in that gap is not lost.
 * Matching is by path-string identity (plus X's FileId, when the extended notify API is
 * available) captured at the last rebuild — not re-validated on the retain path, and NOT
 * re-derived when X is deleted and recreated at the same path (a narrower instance of
 * the "identified by path" trade-off already present elsewhere in this file). P watches
 * only ONE level above X: P's own handle is opened the same FILE_SHARE_DELETE way as
 * X's, so a rename of P itself (or of anything above it) is just as invisible to P's
 * handle as X's own rename is to X's — nothing here watches P's parent for P being a
 * renamed/moved child entry. That case surfaces the same way any undetected-in-real-
 * time rename does: X's content next changes and triggers a bind() retry, not a
 * dedicated watch. Best effort, two DIFFERENT failure shapes: (1) TRANSIENT — if P
 * cannot be armed on a given attempt (open/read failure, and no ancestor watch is
 * active because X's own handle succeeded), no arm_retry is scheduled; it is simply
 * retried, fresh, on the next ordinary bind() call — a rename of X goes undetected
 * until X's content next changes and triggers that retry. (2) TERMINAL — if a
 * teardown's cancel-drain repeatedly fails to confirm (see ParentIoRelease/
 * kParentIoAbandonLimit below), P is PERMANENTLY disabled for the rest of this
 * guard's lifetime (logged once, at error level) — no further retry of any kind,
 * until the rule is next re-armed (a policy re-push or an agent restart). Either
 * way, X's own detection (presence/content, evaluated on every wake) is unaffected;
 * only P's rename-of-X detection is lost.
 *
 * Detection-only: a FileGuard never writes (file-content remediation needs
 * Content Distribution; deferred). Proto-free + windows.h-free header. On
 * non-Windows the guard is a no-op (start() returns false).
