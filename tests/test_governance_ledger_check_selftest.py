"""Self-test for scripts/ci/check-governance-ledger.py - the author-side
governance-ledger linter.

The linter is ADVISORY (a pre-push self-check the /governance skill runs on the
current run's fragment, not a corpus CI gate). This self-test does NOT lint the
real corpus; it (1) PINS the linter's policy constants against literals so a
silent edit to a band, an enum, or the eight per-row mandatory fields fails
here in reviewed test code (mirroring tests/test_seam_closure_selftest.py),
and (2) feeds the checker synthetic good/bad fragments and asserts it
DISCRIMINATES - a conforming ledger (including the prescribed SPARSE-
supersession shape, which restates ONLY changed fields plus the eight
per-row-mandatory ones) yields nothing, a NON-conforming sparse row that omits
one of the eight fires, an intermediate violation a later row restores is
still caught (the ledger is a FIELD-WISE MERGE, not last-row-wins), and a
malformed `recorded_at` is flagged rather than silently swallowed - including
the dangerous direction where it can hide a real severity escalation.
(3) exercises the CLI exit-code contract via subprocess, pinned to a scratch
git repo so the --base tests don't depend on this checkout's own state.

Imports the hyphenated script via importlib. Stdlib only. Exit 0 = pass.

    # Fable's OWN confirmation pass on the first version of these two locks
    # (below) found they pinned the wrong boundary: leaving _frac_key
    # BYTE-IDENTICAL and instead wrapping ITS RESULT with
    # `Decimal("0." + _frac_key(ra))` one frame up, inside _order_key,
    # defeated BOTH locks - lock (a) only walked _frac_key's own source, and
    # lock (b) only called _frac_key directly, never the sort path that
    # actually wraps its result. That mutant crashes real usage identically
    # to round 8's shipped defect (verified: reintroducing it and blocking
    # `_decimal` reproduces the exact `int(str)` 4300-digit ValueError,
    # while the unwidened locks below both passed it clean). Two
    # independent locks, now scoped to the WHOLE numeric-conversion surface

    #     just _frac_key - asserting no `import decimal`/`from decimal
    #     import ...`/`import fractions` and no call named
    #     Decimal/Fraction/int/float ANYWHERE. Scoping to the whole module
    #     (rather than one function) is what catches a Decimal-wrapping
