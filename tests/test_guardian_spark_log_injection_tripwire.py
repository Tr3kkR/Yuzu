"""#4665 tripwire: no NEW spdlog:: call prints a rule-id/Spark-key-shaped value unwrapped.

#4665 closed CWE-117 log-injection on operator-authored Guardian `rule_id` /
Spark `key` (and the path/hive/service/unit-name values a Spark mechanism embeds
in a log line): every raw print site across the agent's guard_*/spark_*/
guardian_* sources and the server's guardian_push_builder.cpp/
guaranteed_state_store.cpp now goes through yuzu::log_id_token / yuzu::
log_key_token (common/include/yuzu/log_token.hpp). This test is the regression
net: it fails the moment a NEW spdlog:: call in the Guardian/Spark subsystem
prints one of these fields unwrapped.

WHY POSITION-AWARE, NOT "does log_id_token/log_key_token appear ANYWHERE in the
statement". A whole-statement substring check passes a multi-argument call
where only ONE of several sensitive arguments is wrapped -- e.g.
`spdlog::warn("rule '{}' key '{}'", log_id_token(rule_id), key)` would pass
with `key` still raw. This is not hypothetical: it is the exact shape fixed at
guardian_spark_runtime.cpp's "key '{}' still has {} queued claim(s) ... for
rule '{}'" site during this sweep (one placeholder wrapped, the other not, in
the SAME statement). So this scanner:
  1. parses each spdlog::LEVEL(...) call's format-string literal (concatenating
     adjacent string-literal tokens, which several real call sites split across
     physical lines) and its argument list separately;
  2. finds every `{}`-shaped placeholder in the literal, in left-to-right
     (= positional) order;
  3. matches SENSITIVE_PATTERNS against the literal's TEXT -- a pattern match's
     character span marks every placeholder whose span overlaps it as sensitive;
  4. maps placeholder i (0-indexed) to argument i (0-indexed) -- the ordinary
     spdlog/fmt convention for bare `{}` placeholders (verified: no call site in
     the scanned tree uses an indexed `{0}` or spec'd `{:...}` placeholder that
     would break this mapping -- grep `spdlog::.*\\{[0-9]` / `\\{:` came back
     empty across the scanned file set at the time this test was written; a
     FUTURE indexed placeholder would silently defeat the positional mapping,
     a documented limitation, not something this scanner detects);
  5. for each sensitive placeholder, requires ITS OWN argument's text (not the
     whole statement) to contain a call to a recognised wrapper or safe
     formatter (WRAP_CALLS / SAFE_FORMATTER_CALLS below) -- substring-within-
     the-argument-slot, which is what correctly flags the two-placeholder gap
     above (only one slot's text contains the call) while still passing a
     wrapped value hidden inside a ternary, e.g.
     `detail.empty() ? "no reason given" : log_key_token(detail)`
     (guardian_spark_runtime.cpp's "subscription {} lost" site) -- the call
     appears somewhere WITHIN that specific argument's own text, not merely
     somewhere in the statement.

FILE SCOPE -- three roots, filtered to the Guardian/Spark basename glob, NOT a
bare three-root scan. "rule" and "key" are common English words: an early,
literal three-root sweep for a bare `key '{}'` pattern hit key_provider.cpp
(KMS key ids), runtime_config_store.cpp (encrypted-blob keys),
custom_properties_store.cpp (schema keys), trigger_engine.cpp (a registry-
trigger key, a DIFFERENT feature from Guardian), server.cpp (a SAML
signing-key path) and grpc_on_behalf_interceptor.hpp (an on-behalf-of metadata
key) -- none are #4665's domain, and none would be caught by a human reviewer
reading a `git grep key` dump without also reading each site. Restricting the
walk to FILE_BASENAME_RE (guardian_*/guard_*/spark_*/guaranteed_state*, the
same basename family the routed-concern rows in .claude/routed-concerns.md use
as the Guardian/Spark trigger surface) removes that false-positive class
without weakening precision inside the subsystem: every literal-substring
pattern below was verified, by a fresh `git grep` sweep of the FILTERED file
set at authoring time, to match ONLY genuine rule-id/Spark-key print sites
(each match's file:line was read and classified by hand) plus, in exactly one
case, a documented false positive that a SECOND condition (a message-prefix
requirement, not a per-file exclusion) resolves -- see the "key '{}'" entry in
SENSITIVE_PATTERNS below.

KNOWN, ACCEPTED, PERMANENT LIMITATION (do not try to close, matching this
repo's convention of stating a check's limits plainly -- see
test_no_connless_pq_escape.py's own header): a format string of bare `"{}"`
with no surrounding sensitive-pattern text is NEVER flagged, because this
scanner decides sensitivity from the LITERAL's text, and a bare `"{}"` carries
none. guardian_engine.cpp's `start_local()` builds `degrade_msg` (a
std::string) by concatenating `"Guardian: rule '" + log_id_token(rule.rule_id())
+ "' failed to re-arm (" + ...` THREE LINES ABOVE its print site
(`spdlog::error("{}", degrade_msg)`) -- the rule_id is correctly wrapped at
the point of concatenation, but this scanner cannot see that: it has no
data-flow analysis, only literal-text pattern matching on the format string
actually passed to spdlog. This is a real, permanent limitation of the lexical
approach (tracing local-variable construction is out of scope), not a scanner
bug -- see _selfcheck()'s degrade_msg-shaped case, which asserts the scanner
does NOT flag it and documents why that is expected.

SAFE FORMATTERS. A call site that passes a raw-looking argument to a function
in SAFE_FORMATTER_CALLS below -- not to spdlog:: directly -- is not flagged;
the wrap happens INSIDE the formatter:
  - format_arm_committed_line() (agents/core/src/guardian_spark_timing.cpp) --
    wraps its rule_id parameter via log_id_token before building the returned
    string (confirmed by reading the implementation). Its one real call site
    (guardian_spark_runtime.cpp) passes the result through
    `spdlog::info("{}", format_arm_committed_line(rule_id, ...))` -- a bare
    `"{}"` literal, so it is not even reached by the sensitivity check (see the
    known-limitation paragraph above); the exemption is still real and
    exercised by _selfcheck() against a synthetic literal that WOULD otherwise
    be flagged, so a future direct call shaped like
    `spdlog::info("... for rule '{}'", format_arm_committed_line(rule_id, ...))`
    stays correctly unflagged too.
  - log_safe() (server/core/src/web_utils.hpp) -- PRE-DATES this sweep (#2542
    PR-7), independent of log_id_token/log_key_token, and folds control bytes
    (0x00-0x1F, 0x7F) to '?' with truncation -- an adequate CWE-117 mitigation
    (no raw CR/LF can survive it) used at guardian_routes.cpp's rate-limited
    "platform support-matrix stale" log line, which #4665 correctly left
    untouched (a different, older call convention, not a regression this sweep
    missed). It is WEAKER than log_token in one respect worth a future
    harmonisation look, not a #4665 gap: it does not fold space or '=', so on a
    space-delimited `k=v k=v` line (which this call site is) a crafted id could
    still forge an adjacent field, though it cannot forge a NEW physical log
    line.

Wired into tests/meson.build (suite 'docs') and .github/workflows/docs-lint.yml,
same precedent shape as test_no_connless_pq_escape.py and
test_split_interlock_tripwire.py. Zero third-party dependencies (stdlib only).
