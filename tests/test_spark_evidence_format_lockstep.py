"""#4665 lockstep: the agent's format_arm_committed_line formatter and the #3990 driver's
T2_RE evidence regex must agree on one golden shape.

Before this test, the formatter's expected output (guardian_spark_timing.cpp, pinned in
tests/unit/test_guardian_spark_runtime.cpp's "#4606 criterion-10" TEST_CASE) and the driver's
own parse-side selftest (docs/spark-rebuild-baselines/fullsync_blackout_diag.py's `_f2`) each
independently hand-spelled the SAME rendered-line literal -- a one-sided change to either
passed both suites independently. tests/unit/fixtures/spark/arm_committed_line.json is now
the single source of truth for that shape: the C++ pin test loads its `input`/`expected_line`
via YUZU_TEST_FIXTURE_DIR, and this file loads the same JSON by its own repo-relative path and
feeds `expected_line` through the driver's REAL T2_RE object (imported from the driver module
itself, not a hand-copied duplicate of the pattern) to check it parses back into
`expected_parsed`.

Also carries the #4665 Task-1 adversarial-forgery regression: an operator-authored free-text
field printed by an UNRELATED log statement can embed a fully-formed fake evidence line with
no newline at all, and an UNANCHORED regex (`.search()`) finds and extracts the forged copy as
if it were real. The driver's own `_f26` selftest is the authoritative copy of this check
against the driver's full fixture set (F1-F26); this file re-asserts it here too, against the
imported module, so a regression is caught by the `docs` suite even if `_f26` is ever run
without this file (and vice versa).

Importing the driver module runs its own module-level `os.makedirs(SCRATCH_DIR,
exist_ok=True)` (SCRATCH_DIR sourced from YUZU_BLACKOUT_SCRATCH) -- its only import-time side
effect (generate_resgate_load, the driver's own sibling import, is side-effect-free at
import: env-var reads only, no I/O, no network). Pointed at a throwaway tempfile.mkdtemp()
here so importing the driver never touches a real scratch path or collides with a concurrent
CI job on the same shared runner box (#1871).

Wired into tests/meson.build (suite 'docs') and .github/workflows/docs-lint.yml (merge ref),
alongside tests/test_no_connless_pq_escape.py.
