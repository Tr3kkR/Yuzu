"""Self-test that locks scripts/ci/check-seam-closure.py against silent
neutering (WS-A4 item 1's per-family seam-enforcement scaffold, ADR-0031
migration step 3).

check-seam-closure.py's own FAMILIES/FORBIDDEN_HEADER_PATTERNS module-level
constants are the entire policy the gate enforces - a PR could quietly widen
the gate (drop a TU from the `network` family's list, narrow a forbidden
pattern so a real store header stops matching) with nothing else in the tree
noticing. This test pins those constants against frozen values HERE, in test
code, so changing the real policy means also editing this file in the same
reviewed change - a loud, auditable path, not a silent JSON/constant edit.
Mirrors tests/test_split_interlock_tripwire_selftest.py's shape for the
sibling WS-0 gate.

It also runs a POSITIVE-FIRE PROBE: builds a synthetic root/src/include tree
containing a TU that includes a real forbidden-pattern header, and asserts
the checker's own `check_family()` flags it (returns False) via the SAME
FORBIDDEN_HEADER_PATTERNS the shipped gate uses - proving the gate actually
fires on the policy it claims to enforce, not merely that it returns green on
the current tree (which a checker that always returns True would also do).

Not wired through subprocess against an alternate ledger file (unlike the
interlock selftest) because check-seam-closure.py's policy is in-module
constants, not an external file the CI job could point elsewhere; instead
this imports the checker module directly (`importlib.util.spec_from_file_
location`, matching scripts/ci/test_check_pg_shard_partition.py's own
established pattern for a hyphenated script) and calls its functions with
explicit `Roots` overrides, so no monkeypatching of the real module globals
is needed and the real repo tree is never touched by the probe.

Wired into .github/workflows/docs-lint.yml alongside check-seam-closure.py
itself. Stdlib only.
