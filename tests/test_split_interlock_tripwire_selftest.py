"""Self-test that locks the split interlock merge-gate against silent neutering.

tests/test_split_interlock_tripwire.py enforces the ADR-0032 interlock by reading
its policy out of tests/split_interlock_ledger.json — a repo file editable in the
very PR the gate polices. That makes the gate tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF: on
its own, a PR could open the gate by editing one JSON value (drop a cell from
gate_set, widen exclude_paths past where new engine code lands, delete an
engine-path marker, or flip a markerless gate cell green) with nothing to catch it.

This self-test is the lock. It pins the ledger's LOAD-BEARING CONSTANTS against
frozen values HERE, in test code, so neutering the gate requires editing these
constants too — which fails CI loudly and is a reviewable change the routed-concern
row routes to security review. It also exercises the tripwire's own logic against
mutated ledgers — the false-certification (RULE 2) path, the excluded-rationale guard,
the malformed-ledger error path, AND that RULE 1 actually FIRES on an engine-path
marker present in the tree while the gate is red (the last one closes the blind spot a
constant-pin cannot: a logic edit that inverts or removes the engine-path block itself,
which pinning keys/regexes does not catch). Coverage is not exhaustive — it locks the
checks probed here, not every possible logic edit — but it catches the inert-gate shapes
this gate's own prose names as the central risk.

Changing the interlock legitimately (e.g. WS-A6 lands a new gate prerequisite) means
editing BOTH the ledger and the matching constant below, in the same reviewed PR —
which is the intended, loud, auditable path, not a bug.

Wired into .github/workflows/docs-lint.yml alongside the tripwire. Stdlib only.
