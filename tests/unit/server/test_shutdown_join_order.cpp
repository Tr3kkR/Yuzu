/**
 * test_shutdown_join_order.cpp -- #3495 regression guard: ServerImpl::stop()
 * must call agent_server_->Shutdown(deadline) BEFORE joining any background
 * thread that can be blocked inside AgentRegistry::send_to() ->
 * stream->Write() (policy evaluation, pre-flight runner, quarantine
 * containment reconciler, schedule tick).
 *
 * WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS. All four of those threads synchronously call into
 * a gRPC stream write with no bound of its own -- it can stall indefinitely
 * on an HTTP/2 flow-control window. `agent_server_->Shutdown(deadline)` is
 * the ONLY thing in `stop()` that forcibly cancels such a write. Before
 * #3495, Shutdown(deadline) ran AFTER the joins, so a thread blocked
 * inside a write had no path to unblock: a normal SIGTERM had no in-process
 * timed escalation for this case, so `stop()` could hang until an external
 * SIGKILL (e.g. Kubernetes' post-grace-period kill) arrived, losing the
 * final audit/evidence rows for whatever was in flight and skipping every
 * later teardown step. Found via governance #3495 (chaos-injector HIGH +
 * codex external tie-break, 2026-08-24) on the same shape #3042 and #3007
 * already document for other components. The original #3495 fix covered
 * only three of the four threads (missed `policy_eval_thread_`, which
 * dispatches through the identical shared `command_dispatch_fn` closure) --
 * caught in this PR's own Gate 3 governance re-review, closed in the same
 * PR rather than deferred. This test now covers all four so a future
 * regression on any one of them fails loudly, not silently like the
 * original miss did.
 *
 * MECHANISM -- no hand-copied line numbers. This test opens server.cpp (via
 * `YUZU_SERVER_SRC_DIR`, injected by tests/meson.build) AT TEST RUN TIME and
 * locates, by regex, the single call sites for:
 *   - `agent_server_->Shutdown(deadline)`
 *   - `policy_eval_thread_.join()`
 *   - `preflight_runner_thread_.join()`
 *   - `quarantine_reconcile_thread_.join()`
 *   - `schedule_tick_thread_.join()`
 *   - `heartbeat_ingestion_->set_quarantine_reconcile_fn(nullptr)`
 * then asserts Shutdown's line number is strictly BEFORE each of the four
 * joins', and strictly BEFORE the fn-null wait's (re-verifying the #3495
 * acceptance criterion that this wait's already-bounded shape must not
 * regress to unbounded when the reorder lands).
 *
 * Same technique and same rationale as test_store_wiring_order.cpp's #3261
 * guard: `ServerImpl` is not unit-constructible (see test_default_certs.cpp),
 * so a source-scan is the only thing that catches an ordering regression in
 * a function this large without standing up a live gRPC server and
 * deliberately stalling a stream write (issue #3495's own suggested-scope
 * item 6 notes that would need an integration or TSan-assisted test, not a
 * unit test -- this guard covers the ordering property directly instead;
 * governance Gate 3 cpp-safety, 2026-08-30, recommended a follow-up issue
 * for that runtime-level coverage rather than adding it to this PR).
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCAN DOES NOT CATCH: that Shutdown's 5s deadline is itself
 * sufficient in practice, that the join actually completes once cancellation
 * lands, or any change to whichever OTHER statements sit between these call
 * sites. It proves relative source order only -- exactly the property that
 * regressed once already (the joins predate Shutdown's call site by ~150
 * lines before this fix), and that a fourth caller of the same shared
 * dispatch closure can be missed even by a reviewer looking directly at this
 * function (the original #3495 PR's own diff touched this exact area and
 * still missed policy_eval_thread_).
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCAN DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: assert that command_dispatch_fn
 * has exactly four production consumers, or catch a FIFTH one added later
 * with its join placed correctly relative to the others but still by
 * coincidence rather than by any enforced rule. There is no compile-time or
 * test-time chokepoint tying "joins command_dispatch_fn" to "joins after
 * Shutdown(deadline)" -- Gate 3 architect flagged this absence explicitly
 * (2026-08-30) as a standing risk for the next thread added to this
 * closure's caller list, not something this PR's scope closes.
