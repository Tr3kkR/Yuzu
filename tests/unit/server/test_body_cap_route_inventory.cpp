/**
 * test_body_cap_route_inventory.cpp — #2407 architect-mandated route-inventory
 * coverage: prove every ACTUALLY REGISTERED POST/PUT/PATCH route resolves to
 * a DELIBERATE `body_cap_policy.hpp` class, not a silent, unreviewed
 * fallthrough to the catch-all default.
 *
 * WHY test_body_cap_policy.cpp IS NOT ENOUGH. That sibling file locks
 * `kBodyCapTable`'s own contents against an independently hand-copied
 * expectation list — it proves the table is internally self-consistent, but
 * the table has no idea the real route surface exists. If a future route is
 * added to `rest_api_v1.cpp` (or any other route file) and nobody adds a
 * matching `kBodyCapTable` entry, test_body_cap_policy.cpp stays green — the
 * table it locks did not change. The new route silently inherits the 4 MiB
 * catch-all default and is refused in production with a 413 nobody
 * anticipated, at a layer (server.cpp's pre-routing handler) the route's
 * author never looked at. Only a comparison against the ACTUAL REGISTERED
 * ROUTE TABLE — this file — can catch that.
 *
 * MECHANISM — no hand-copied route list. A hand-copied list goes stale
 * exactly like the thing it's testing. This test opens every `*.cpp` AND
 * `*.inc` file under `server/core/src` (recursively, via
 * `YUZU_SERVER_SRC_DIR`, injected by tests/meson.build from
 * `meson.project_source_root()`) AT TEST RUN TIME and regex-scans the raw
 * source text for every `Post`/`Put`/`Patch`/`Delete` call on one of THREE
 * receiver spellings actually used in this codebase (verified against the
 * full source tree, not recalled):
 *   - `sink.Post(...)` / `sink.Put(...)` / ... — the `HttpRouteSink` seam
 *     (http_route_sink.hpp) that most route owners now register through;
 *   - `svr.Post(...)` / `svr.Put(...)` / ... — the small set of route
 *     owners not yet migrated onto that seam; or
 *   - `web_server_->Post(...)` / `web_server_->Put(...)` / ... — routes
 *     registered directly on the underlying `httplib::Server` member
 *     (server.cpp itself, plus any `.inc` file it textually `#include`s).
 *     A prior version of this scan matched only `sink.`/`svr.` and missed
 *     this receiver ENTIRELY — 39 of 176 POST/PUT/PATCH registrations (22%)
 *     were invisible to it, concentrated in server.cpp, the very file a
 *     route-inventory guard most needs to see. Do not narrow this back to
 *     two receivers without re-measuring that count is still zero.
 * A route added anywhere — a new file, a new `.inc`, or a new call on any of
 * the three receivers in an existing file — is picked up automatically on
 * the next test run. Nothing here needs updating when a route is ADDED;
 * something here needs updating only when a route's RESOLVED CLASS is new
 * and needs a considered decision (see `kDefaultIsCorrectFor` below).
 *
 * REGENERATING: nothing to regenerate by hand — the scan runs fresh every
 * test invocation (see the CACHING note below for what "fresh" actually
 * means per process). If you add a route and this test fails, it is telling
 * you the route resolves to the catch-all default and has not yet had a
 * decision recorded for it. Fix it one of two ways:
 *   (a) it genuinely needs its own cap — add an entry to `kBodyCapTable` in
 *       body_cap_policy.hpp (owned by that file, see its header for the
 *       chokepoint/matching rules); or
 *   (b) the 4 MiB default is the right, deliberate choice for it — add
 *       `{method, EXACT registered path text, one-line reason}` to
 *       `kDefaultIsCorrectFor` below.
 * If instead an *existing* `kDefaultIsCorrectFor` entry starts failing (the
 * "no stale allowlist entries" test case below), the route it names was
 * either removed or given its own `kBodyCapTable` entry — delete the
 * allowlist row.
 *
 * REGEX PATH PROBES. httplib regex-registered routes (e.g.
 * `sink.Put(R"(/api/v1/management-groups/([a-f0-9]+))", ...)`) are not
 * literal paths, but `resolve_body_cap` matches literal segment-boundary
 * prefixes (body_cap_policy.hpp's `body_cap_prefix_matches`). Each capture
 * group `(...)` in an extracted pattern is replaced with a fixed
 * placeholder segment ("X") to build a representative concrete PROBE path —
 * this codebase's httplib capture groups are a single level, never nested
 * (verified against every registration extant at the time of writing), so a
 * non-nested `\([^()]*\)` replacement is exact. Replacing in place (rather
 * than truncating at the first capture group) preserves every literal
 * segment BEFORE *and* AFTER the capture, which matters: an entry that is
 * only distinguishable by a literal suffix after an id segment (there is
 * none in `kBodyCapTable` today, but nothing stops one being added) would be
 * missed by a naive prefix-only probe.
 *
 * SCOPE. GET registrations carry no meaningful pre-auth body surface in
 * this codebase and stay out of the main inventory check, covered only by
 * the best-effort "GET reads req.body" shape-trap check below — a substring
 * heuristic over the handler's approximate source span, not a real parse.
 * It found zero hits when this file was written; a hit is a signal to go
 * read the route by hand, not an automatic verdict. DELETE is IN scope
 * (unlike an earlier version of this comment claimed): `resolve_body_cap`'s
 * catch-all default entry is `kBodyCapAnyMethod`-scoped, so it already caps
 * every DELETE registration at 4 MiB whether or not this test extracts
 * them — and at least one DELETE handler parses `req.body`
 * (`rest_api_v1.cpp`'s `DELETE /api/v1/management-groups/{id}/roles`,
 * `req.body` read at line 2112, and `DELETE /api/v1/engine-principals/{id}`
 * reads an optional `superseded_by` field). A route-inventory guard that
 * cannot see DELETE registrations cannot confirm either of those bodies
 * stays within the default it silently inherits, so DELETE is extracted
 * and checked exactly like POST/PUT/PATCH below.
 *
 * CACHING. The file corpus (`read_all_cpp_files`) and the extracted
 * mutating-route list (`discover_mutating_routes`) are each memoized behind
 * a function-local `static const`, computed once per test PROCESS rather
 * than once per `TEST_CASE` — this file has four `TEST_CASE`s and three of
 * them call `discover_mutating_routes()`, so the un-cached scan (a full
 * `std::regex` pass over every server source file) used to run 3-4x per
 * process for no reason: measured 8.2-8.5 s wall on Linux at `-O2` before
 * caching (worse under MSVC's slower `std::regex`, and worse again as the
 * source tree grows — this cost is O(tree size) and was unbounded). Both
 * caches assume every call in this TU passes the same `YUZU_SERVER_SRC_DIR`
 * directory, which is true today (there is exactly one call site for each
 * with a hard-coded argument) — do not reuse either helper with a different
 * directory without splitting the cache key.
