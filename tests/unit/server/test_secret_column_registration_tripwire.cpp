// #2530 registered-column trip-wire (contract item 4 / C3).
//
// WHY THIS TEST EXISTS: `pg::SecretCodec::rewrap_all` scans a registered
// secret column with a single UNBATCHED, client-side-materialized query — it
// currently reads the whole column into memory in one shot. That is a real
// scale risk that a single registrant (auth.users.mfa_totp_secret) has kept
// invisible so far. Registering a SECOND secret column would multiply that
// scan and can push a rewrap past `statement_timeout` on a large table — the
// batching work (#2530 UP-10/11/12) is deliberately DEFERRED, not done here.
// This test pins the registered set at exactly one column so that the moment
// someone adds a second `register_secret_column` call anywhere in the
// codebase, THIS test fails loudly and forces an explicit decision about the
// deferred batching work, rather than the second column silently inheriting
// whatever ceiling the first one was living under. Read this comment before
// updating the expected set below.
//
// Do NOT "fix" this by adding a runtime guard inside SecretCodec that refuses
// a second registration — SecretCodec is, by design, the registry for every
// secret-bearing store in the server, and a second legitimate store adding
// its own secret column is normal schema evolution. A runtime refusal would
// turn that into a boot outage. This test is the deliberate, reviewable
// speed bump instead (architect-ruled, #2530 contract §C3).
//
// PRODUCTION WIRING, NOT A HAND-BUILT CODEC: this test constructs its own
// `pg::SecretCodec` and hands it to a REAL `yuzu::server::AuthDB` by
// reference (AuthDB's constructor takes `pg::SecretCodec&`), then reads
// `registered_columns()` back off the codec it owns. That is exactly the
// production registration path in server.cpp (FileKeyProvider -> SecretCodec
// constructed-not-inited -> AuthDB, which registers `mfa_totp_secret` in its
// constructor at auth_db.cpp:431) with no new accessor added to AuthDB and no
// hand-rolled substitute registration. `SecretCodec::init()` is deliberately
// NOT called here — the trip-wire only cares about what got registered, not
// substrate-level KEK bootstrap.
