/**
 * test_ota_stalled_write.cpp — the load-bearing claim behind #911 UP-101:
 * that `ServerContext::TryCancel()`, fired from the watchdog's sweeper thread,
 * actually unblocks a SYNCHRONOUS `grpc::ServerWriter::Write` that has stalled
 * on a collapsed HTTP/2 receive window.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST HAD TO EXIST. Everything else about the watchdog is covered
 * deterministically in `test_ota_transfer_watchdog.cpp` with an injected clock
 * and a flag standing in for the cancel. But that leaves the one thing the whole
 * mechanism rests on unproven: those tests would pass identically if
 * `TryCancel` did nothing to a blocked write. A gate-1 review flagged exactly
 * that. gRPC's sync API has no per-write deadline and keepalive does not detect
 * this case — a peer with a zero receive window keeps answering pings — so if
 * this claim were false, `DownloadUpdate` would pin a server thread forever and
 * the P0 would be unfixed while every other test stayed green.
 *
 * HOW IT AVOIDS NEEDING A PACKAGE ON DISK. The production handler streams from
 * an `UpdateRegistry`, which needs a `PgPool`. This test instead stands up a
 * test-local service that derives from the SAME `pb::AgentService::Service` and
 * overrides `DownloadUpdate` to stream from memory through a REAL
 * `OtaTransferWatchdog` with its REAL sweeper thread. No proto change, no
 * production test-seam, no Postgres. What it proves is the MECHANISM; that the
 * production handler wires that mechanism the same way is covered by
 * `test_ota_download_bound.cpp` and by reading the handler.
 *
 * The stall is produced honestly: the client starts the call and then never
 * calls `Read()`. Its receive window fills, it stops issuing window updates, and
 * the server's `Write` blocks with no way out but cancellation.
