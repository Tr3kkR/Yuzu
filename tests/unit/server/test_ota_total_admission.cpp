/**
 * test_ota_total_admission.cpp — the server-wide OTA gate's OCCUPANCY.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `test_ota_download_bound.cpp` proves the gate is wired
 * into the real handler over the real wire, but it can only reach it one call
 * at a time: `max_concurrent_total=0` refuses with the counter untouched
 * (`prev = 0 >= 0`), and a cap of 1 driven sequentially admits with the counter
 * untouched (`prev` is 0 on every call). A governance pass verified the
 * consequence — deleting the increment left the whole `[ota]` suite green.
 *
 * Holding a live `DownloadUpdate` mid-transfer would need a package on disk and
 * a peer that stalls, which is exactly what that file documents it cannot do.
 * So the counting is proven HERE instead, on the extracted gate: deterministic,
 * single-threaded, no timing.
