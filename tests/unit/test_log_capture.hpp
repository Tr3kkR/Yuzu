/**
 * test_log_capture.hpp — RAII spdlog default-logger capture into a string.
 *
 * Promoted from the inline block in test_licensing_sync.cpp's
 * "k_agent never appears in the blob or in captured logs" test (governance
 * CON-S4 — promote-at-second-user). The #2238 second user
 * (test_guardian_engine_spark_reconcile.cpp) was removed after a macOS CI
 * failure showed this class's swap does not reach spdlog:: calls made from
 * code compiled into a separate shared library (libyuzu_agent_core is a
 * .dylib there) — the swap happens in the TEST BINARY's image, and that
 * image apparently does not share spdlog's default-logger/registry state
 * with the library's own image on every supported toolchain. This class is
 * therefore reliable ONLY for logging done by code compiled directly into
 * the same test binary (which is exactly test_licensing_sync.cpp's case —
 * sync_source_software_licensing.cpp is, however, ALSO compiled into
 * libyuzu_agent_core, so that test's own LogCapture use likely has the SAME
 * exposure; its assertions are negative (logs.find(key) == npos), so an
 * empty/unreachable capture would pass it vacuously rather than fail loudly.
 * Not yet verified or fixed — flagged for a follow-up, not addressed here.
 *
 * For code compiled into a separate shared library, prefer recording the
 * observable directly as a plain object member with a `_for_test` accessor
 * at the point of emission (see GuardianEngine::last_rearm_degrade_message_for_test
 * for the pattern this replaced) — object state has no cross-image hazard.
 *
 * A separate header rather than folding into test_helpers.hpp: this pulls in
 * spdlog's ostream sink, which most test_helpers.hpp consumers don't need.
