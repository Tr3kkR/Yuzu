// Unit tests for ScopedOfflineHiveLock (agents/core/include/yuzu/agent/offline_hive_mutex.hpp):
// the RAII wrapper around the process-wide offline-hive-mount mutex shared by five plugins
// (autoruns, installed_apps, license_scan, registry, tar) via with_user_hive().
//
// Scope note: this covers B1 (acquire-on-construct / release-on-destruct / mutual exclusion)
// only. The wait/hold-time logging behaviour (constructor and destructor spdlog calls) is
// deliberately NOT exercised here with a throwing-sink or capturing-sink fixture:
//   - offline_hive_mutex.cpp is compiled into libyuzu_agent_core (a separate .dylib/.so from
//     this test binary), and tests/unit/test_log_capture.hpp's own header documents an
//     observed, unresolved (#3355) cross-image hazard where a default-logger swap made from
//     the test binary's image does not reliably reach spdlog:: calls made from code compiled
//     into that separate library on every toolchain -- a throwing/capturing-sink test here
//     would risk passing vacuously (false-green) rather than actually exercising the
//     destructor's try/catch.
//   - the exception-safety property itself (a `catch (...)` around a log call cannot let that
//     call's exception escape) is a language-level guarantee, not a runtime behaviour that
//     needs a dynamic proof; code-review verified both the constructor's and destructor's
//     guards directly.
// The lock/unlock and RAII-scope contract below has no such hazard and is fully proven here.
