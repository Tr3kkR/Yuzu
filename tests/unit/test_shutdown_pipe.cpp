/**
 * test_shutdown_pipe.cpp — pins the REAL ShutdownWatcher (agents/core/src/shutdown_watcher.hpp).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it tests the real class rather than a copy of it.
 *
 * The agent's graceful shutdown runs through a self-pipe: the signal handler writes ONE byte,
 * and a watcher thread parked in read() wakes and runs the teardown. A single wrong flag
 * silently disables all of it — `pipe2(fds, O_CLOEXEC | O_NONBLOCK)` sets O_NONBLOCK on BOTH
 * descriptors, so the watcher's read() returns EAGAIN immediately, the thread exits within
 * microseconds, and SIGTERM stops triggering a graceful stop. Nothing LOOKS broken: the
 * process still dies via the signal's default disposition.
 *
 * That exact bug shipped once. The test at the time RE-IMPLEMENTED the pipe ("build it the
 * same way the watcher does") and so pinned a COPY — it passed while the real code was
 * broken. Hence the class now lives in a header and this file drives the real type. Testing a
 * copy is not testing. (governance Gate-8 cpp-safety.)
