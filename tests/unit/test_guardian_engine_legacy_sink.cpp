/**
 * test_guardian_engine_legacy_sink.cpp — #4783 fix proof: the legacy Guardian
 * sink call (GuardianEngine::emit_guard_event -> EventSink -> AgentImpl's gRPC
 * Write() on the Subscribe stream) no longer runs on the guard's own detection
 * thread. Before this fix, a stalled (not dead) gRPC stream blocked that
 * thread indefinitely: a legacy guard worker parked mid-report could not
 * notice a subsequent real endpoint transition until the stream unblocked,
 * and GuardianEngine::stop() / a rule-dropping apply_rules() both joined
 * guard threads under mtx_, so either could hang the whole engine (and, in
 * production, the agent's shutdown or rule-management path) on one wedged
 * sender.
 *
 * Commit 3 of the delivery plan routes emit_guard_event() through
 * GuardianLegacySinkExecutor (guardian_legacy_sink_executor.hpp, added in
 * commit 2): the guard's own thread only ENQUEUES and returns immediately — a
 * blocking (or merely slow) network send now runs on the executor's own
 * DETACHED worker, never on the thread that detected the drift. These cases
 * were committed RED (commit 1, tagged [!mayfail]) against the pre-fix engine
 * and are GREEN against the fix landed here — see:
 *   ~/.claude/plans/4783-legacy-guard-sink-blocking-PLAN-v2.md, S4 (T2) and S5
 *   (commits 1 and 3).
 *
 * Every operation that could hang under the (now-fixed) hazard still runs on
 * a helper thread behind `run_bounded()` below, which always releases the
 * blocking sink's latch and joins the helper before returning — so a
 * regression here is a clean, reported CHECK failure, never a wedged test
 * binary. `run_bounded()` aborts the WHOLE process (spdlog::critical +
 * std::abort()) only if the helper fails to recover even after the latch is
 * released, i.e. a genuinely different hazard than the one this file exists
 * to guard against. Every case ALSO physically retires the legacy-sink
 * executor's detached worker before its locals destruct
 * (`require_legacy_sink_retired()` below, via a `ScopeExit` so it runs on
 * every exit path including a failed REQUIRE/CHECK): `BlockingSink`/
 * `CountingSink` capture `this` by raw pointer, and delivery is now
 * asynchronous, so nothing may still reference either after this test
 * function's locals start unwinding.
 *
 * Local fixture: LegacySinkFixture below is a minimal, INDEPENDENT analogue
 * of test_guardian_engine.cpp's GuardianFixture — that fixture lives inside
 * an anonymous namespace in a different translation unit and cannot be
 * reused from here (see this file's own PLAN section, and the plan doc's
 * T2 header note). guard_*.{hpp,cpp} are untouched by this commit — only
 * guardian_engine.{hpp,cpp} and agent.cpp (see the plan's commit-3 scope).
 *
 * CH-1(a)/(b) and CH-2 arm a REAL FileGuard, which is Windows-only for the
 * MVP (FileGuard::start() is a no-op returning false off Windows —
 * guard_file.cpp) — those cases (plus the Windows-only shutdown-path
 * regression added in commit 3) are #ifdef _WIN32 and simply do not exist in
 * a non-Windows build. CH-1 L1 and the two cross-platform commit-3 additions
 * (FIFO preservation, stop()-discards-backlog) drive the synchronous half of
 * emit_guard_event() directly via guardian_emit_drift_for_test(), with no
 * real guard thread involved, and are the only cases exercised on this
 * (Linux) build.
