// getnameinfo's reverse-DNS lookup has no per-call timeout, and a
// black-holing resolver could otherwise pin a worker on the agent's bounded

// round 4) once agent-core's server_address_resolver.cpp needed the same
// primitive to bound its own getaddrinfo() call.
// These tests use a synthetic slow callable rather than real DNS, so the
// timeout behaviour is deterministic and network-independent.
