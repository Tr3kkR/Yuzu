/**
 * test_passwd_lookup.cpp -- yuzu::agent::resolve_passwd_bounded (#3406).
 *
 * These exist because of a specific defect class found in adversarial review:
 * argv-izing the certificates plugin's login-keychain read moved a
 * passwd/Directory-Services lookup out of a SIGKILL-able child process and
 * into an in-process call. On a directory-joined Mac that call can block with
 * no timeout of its own, and an uncancellable block on the agent's bounded
 * ThreadPool pins a worker per request.
 *
 * The load-bearing case is therefore NOT "a lookup resolves" -- it is
 * "a lookup that NEVER RETURNS still gives the caller its thread back inside
 * the budget". A suite that only proved the happy path would leave the actual
 * regression unobserved, which is exactly how the defect reached review.
 *
 * The injected-lookup seam these use is the same one that makes the real
 * resolver's rc/ERANGE/no-record branches reachable at all; before it, they
 * were file-local in the plugin .cpp and no test could touch them.
