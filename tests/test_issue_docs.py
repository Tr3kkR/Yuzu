"""Repo-hygiene checks for the issue-lifecycle standard (ADR-3001, Amendment A1)
and the instruction-file standard (docs/instruction-file-standard.md).

Invariants that must hold on every platform:

1. The four ALWAYS-LOADED instruction files -- CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and the
   two routed-concern tables CLAUDE.md @-imports -- each stay under a 32,000
   character budget, behind the 40,000 hard cap. Counted UTF-8-decoded in
   Python deliberately: these files are dense with multi-byte punctuation, so
   byte counts (`wc -c`, and `wc -m` on Windows Git Bash, which degrades to
   bytes) read ~300 higher than the character count -- the exact confusion
   Amendment A1 par.8 corrects.

   The budget sits below the cap so the next approach is caught with runway.
   Previously only CLAUDE.md was measured, and the ceiling was hit three times;
   the second breach was found at 39,996 of 40,000 bytes, and the unmeasured
   routed-concern tables had independently reached 38,545 and 37,808 while
   AGENTS.md sat 25% over a cap nothing applied to it.

   Also enforced on those four files:
     - EXPIRES: markers -- a temporary section whose date has passed fails the
       build. A workstreams block outlived its stated window by four weeks,
       with its own teardown procedure already written, because nothing checked.
     - Dead pointers -- a backticked repo path that resolves nowhere fails.
       Three citations pointed into a private memory directory and resolved
       nowhere, not even on the author's own machine. Deliberate absences go in
       ABSENT_BY_DESIGN with a reason.

2. scripts/tracker/do-not-close.txt parses -- integers only (one per line,
   '#' comments allowed), no duplicates, never empty. Every automated close
   path reads this file; a malformed line silently shrinking the never-close
   set is exactly the failure a green build must catch.

3. docs/agents/issue-standard.md exists and still contains its never-close
   section (5.1), which do-not-close.txt and the automation cite as their
   authority.

Wired into tests/meson.build (suite: docs), mirroring test_changelog_order.py.
