#
# The classifier is the docs-only gate for ci.yml (issue #1978): it decides
# whether a PR skips the self-hosted build matrix. A silent regression (an
# ignore arm dropped, `*.md` accidentally matching nested paths, the truncation
# guard removed) would either block every docs PR again or, worse, let real
# code merge without the required build. This exercises the code/docs/mixed,
# root-vs-nested pattern semantics, the ignore set, and the 3000-file
# truncation guard hermetically — no network, no GitHub. It also exercises the
# named CI-infrastructure class against a temporary git repository, including
# the former false-green: an unresolvable diff base must select the canary.
