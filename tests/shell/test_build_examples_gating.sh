# test_build_examples_gating.sh — #4262 smoke test.
#
# `-Dbuild_examples=false` must still configure a full, working build: only
# the four decorative demo plugins (example, chargen, procfetch, netprobe)
# are omitted, every real plugin and the test suite's link_depends still
# resolve. Before #4262 this configuration failed at `meson setup` with an
# undefined-variable error the moment any real plugin's `*_plugin_lib`
# was referenced outside the (then much wider) build_examples gate.
#
# Configure only — no compile — to keep this cheap enough to run on every
# CI leg rather than a dedicated slow job. A full compile+link+test pass of
# this configuration is verified manually per-change; this smoke test's job
# is only to keep the flag from silently regressing.
#
# Beyond a bare `meson setup` exit code, this also introspects the
# configured targets (still configure-only — `meson introspect --targets`
# needs no compile) and asserts the EXACT boundary: EVERY agents/plugins/*/
# directory except the four demo plugins has a matching target present,
# and the four demo plugins are absent. A bare setup-succeeds check would
# stay green even if a real plugin were silently re-gated behind
# build_examples (as long as nothing else referenced its *_plugin_lib
# variable) -- true of 24 of the 48 real plugins, since only 24 are
# load-bearing link_depends of yuzu_agent_tests (governance Gate 4
# unhappy-path UP-6). Checking the full discovered set, not a fixed
# sample, closes that gap regardless of which plugin a future mistake
# targets.
