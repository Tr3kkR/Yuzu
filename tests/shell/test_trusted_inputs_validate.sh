# test_trusted_inputs_validate.sh — contract net for ci.yml's `trusted_inputs`
# validate step, the SOLE chokepoint deciding which commit every downstream CI
# job builds.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Two independent reviewers of #2832 flagged the same gap: the
# adjacent shell gates run in that very job have dedicated tests
# (test_check_compose_versions.sh, test_detect_code_change.sh) while the step
# that picks the BUILD COMMIT had none, so nothing short of a live Actions run
# could catch a regression in it. #2832 itself is the proof: its first version
# pinned `checkout_ref` to a bare SHA for EVERY non-workflow_call trigger,
# including `push`, which leaves a self-hosted workspace in detached HEAD and
# permanently disarms the branch-switch build-dir wipe (that sentinel's guard is
# `current != "HEAD"`, and `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` prints exactly
# "HEAD" when detached). No test saw it; a reviewer did.
#
# WHAT IT PINS. The branches of the step and the properties each must hold:
#
#   push               -> checkout_ref is a BRANCH REF (attached HEAD, so the
#                         branch-switch wipe still works), checkout_sha is the
#                         event commit, base_sha falls back to the event commit
#   pull_request       -> checkout_ref is the event SHA (immune to GitHub
#                         re-minting refs/pull/N/merge), and equals checkout_sha
#                         so `Verify resolved checkout` compares like with like;
#                         base_sha is the PR base
#   workflow_call, incomplete (no PR number / gate sentinel) -> rejected before
#                         any API call, never falling through to the untrusted
#                         branch
#   workflow_call, wrong cache scope (#4471) -> rejected before any API call:
#                         the dispatch ref is the run's GitHub Actions cache
#                         scope, so only a throwaway trusted-fork/pr-<N>[-<sha>]
#                         branch for THAT PR is accepted — never main, dev, or
#                         another PR's quarantine branch
#   workflow_call, approved in its quarantine scope -> both outputs pinned to
#                         the APPROVED head sha (never anything the fork
#                         controls at run time), trusted_execution=true,
#                         base_sha from the PR, checkout_repository the base
#                         repo
#   workflow_call, malformed approved sha -> rejected outright
#
# The step's own body is extracted from ci.yml rather than duplicated here, so
# this test cannot drift into asserting a copy of the logic instead of the logic.
# `gh` is a hermetic stub (below): the approved path is exercised end to end
# without network, and a PATH slip is detected rather than silently hitting the
# real API.
