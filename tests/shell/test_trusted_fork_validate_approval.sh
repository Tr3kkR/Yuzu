#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_trusted_fork_validate_approval.sh — contract net for trusted-fork-ci.yml's
# `validate-approval` job body (#4471 round-2 review, fjarvis), the SOLE gate
# deciding whether a workflow_dispatch of the trusted CI gate is authorized to
# execute a fork's revision at all.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The job's title-binding check ties a cited review run to
# (PR#, SHA) only -- never to which quarantine BRANCH it ran on. Branch
# reuse-or-fresh across approval rounds is sanctioned, documented behavior
# (docs/ci-troubleshooting.md 1.2), as is a failed purge needing a re-dispatch.
# Put those together: a review run from quarantine branch A, successfully
# reviewed, can be cited to authorize a trusted-gate dispatch on a DIFFERENT
# branch B for the same PR/SHA -- pulling branch A's (possibly
# fork-poisoned, pre-purge) cache scope into the full trusted gate. This test
# pins the fix: the cited review run's own branch must match the branch this
# job is actually dispatched on.

# Run:  bash tests/shell/test_trusted_fork_validate_approval.sh
