# test_capability_matrix_gate.sh — coverage for the #2204 capability-matrix
# machinery: tools/capmatrix-gen + scripts/ci/check-capability-matrix.sh (PR1.1
# finding F10).
#
# WHY: all 49 shipped plugins are still undeclared and
# RATCHET_BASELINE_UNDECLARED is pinned at 49, so the production gate only ever
# observes the all-undeclared, count-equals-baseline state. A green gate
# therefore proved neither that capmatrix-gen renders a DECLARED descriptor
# correctly — the whole reason the generator exists — nor that either ratchet
# rejection branch rejects anything. Both were reachable only by code reading.
#
# This closes both halves against the REAL binary and the REAL gate script:
#   1. Renderer: capmatrix-gen is run over tests/fixtures/abi4/'s declaring
#      fixture plugin and its output is compared BYTE-FOR-BYTE against the
#      expected fragment — every support level, the rung "-" default, the
#      NULL/empty mechanism+fallback defaults, and escape_cell()'s pipe /
#      backslash / newline neutralisation.
#   2. Ratchet: the gate script is run against a hermetic throwaway git repo
#      whose "plugins" are the declaring ABI4 fixture (renders rows) and the
#      frozen ABI3 fixture (lands in the undeclared list), with
#      RATCHET_BASELINE_UNDECLARED rewritten per scenario, so the count-grew
#      and improved-but-baseline-not-lowered branches are each observed
#      rejecting, and the drift diff is observed rejecting a hand-edit.
#
# Hermetic: no network, no GitHub, and the production tree is never mutated —
# every scenario runs inside its own mktemp'd git repo.
#
# Run:  bash tests/shell/test_capability_matrix_gate.sh <BUILDDIR>
