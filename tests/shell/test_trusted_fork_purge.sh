# test_trusted_fork_purge.sh — contract net for the `purge-quarantine-cache`
# job body (#4471), which now exists in BOTH trusted-fork-ci.yml (after the
# gate) and fork-dynamic-review.yml (after the hosted review — added in the
# adversarial-review round: the review run executes code before a maintainer
# approves it, and the runbook dispatches the trusted gate on the SAME
# quarantine ref, so without its own purge the review run's writes were
# restorable by the later gate's canary before that job's own purge ever ran).
# Every cache entry the fork revision wrote into the run's quarantine scope
# must be deleted, by EITHER job, and only that scope may ever be purged. The
# two job bodies are deliberately identical, so this one test drives both.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Neither job can be exercised until the workflow reaches
# main, and the wiring test in scripts/ci/test_runner_health_check.py pins
# structure only (permissions, no checkout, `if: always()`, `needs:`). This
# executes the real step bodies against a stateful stub `gh` that behaves like
# the caches API.
#
# WHAT IT PINS, against BOTH trusted-fork-ci.yml's and fork-dynamic-review.yml's job:
#   wrong ref (main)          -> exit non-zero, ZERO API calls
#   empty scope               -> exit 0, "purged 0"
#   101 entries, two pages    -> every id deleted, exit 0
#   one DELETE fails          -> exit non-zero
#   an entry that never goes  -> exit non-zero with the residual ::error::
