# Building Yuzu on RHEL 9 / Rocky 9 / AlmaLinux 9

This is the enterprise-Linux counterpart to the apt recipe in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. CI
exercises Ubuntu 24.04/26.04, macOS and Windows only — RHEL-family hosts are a supported *developer*
platform, not a CI-covered one, so this doc records a verified sequence rather than an
automatically-regression-tested one.

**One command:**

```bash
bash scripts/setup-rhel9.sh --with-postgres          # provision
source ~/.config/yuzu/toolchain-env.sh               # activate (also hooked into ~/.bashrc)
./scripts/setup.sh --tests --native-file meson/native/linux-gcc13.ini
meson compile -C build-linux
```

The script is idempotent — re-running it on a provisioned box changes nothing. Verify a machine at
any time with `bash scripts/setup-rhel9.sh --check --with-postgres`.

The rest of this doc explains *why* each piece is what it is, because the four things most likely
to bite you (the compiler, the native file, `pg_hba.conf`, and the test role's privileges) all fail
in confusing ways.

---

## The four traps

### 1. The system GCC cannot build this project

RHEL 9's `gcc` is 11. Yuzu is C++23 and the documented floor is **GCC 13+ / Clang 18+**. The fix is
a **Software Collection**: `gcc-toolset-14` ships GCC 14.2.1 *and its own libstdc++ 14 headers*,
which is the part that matters — `<print>`, `<expected>`, and the C++23 `<format>` additions live in
libstdc++, and the base system's `libstdc++-devel` is 11.5.

This also rules out the obvious-looking alternative: AppStream carries `clang` 21, but Clang uses
the *system* libstdc++ headers, so a bare `clang++ -std=c++23` still gets the 11.5 library. Using
Clang here means installing `gcc-toolset-14` anyway and pointing Clang at it with
`--gcc-install-dir`. Not worth it unless you specifically want a second-opinion compile.

A Software Collection must be activated **per shell**:

```bash
source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-14/enable
```

Inside the collection the binaries are plain **`gcc` / `g++`** — *not* `gcc-14` / `g++-14`. That
detail drives trap 2. (gcc-toolset links the newer libstdc++ bits statically, so the binaries you
build still run on the base system without the collection activated.)

### 2. Use `meson/native/linux-gcc13.ini`, whatever your GCC version

The native files are not interchangeable:

| File | Verdict on RHEL 9 |
|---|---|
| `linux-gcc13.ini` | ✅ **Use this.** Contains only `cpp_std = 'c++23'` — no hard-coded binaries, no linker override. Compiler selection comes from `CC`/`CXX`. This is what the GHA-hosted ubuntu-24.04 canary uses. |
| `linux-gcc14.ini` | ❌ Hard-codes `c = 'gcc-14'` / `cpp = 'g++-14'`. Those names do not exist inside the Software Collection — meson fails to find a compiler. |
| `linux-gcc15.ini`, `linux-clang21.ini` | ❌ Both force `-fuse-ld=mold`. `mold` is not in BaseOS/AppStream/CRB (EPEL only) and is not installed by this recipe — every link fails. |

The name "gcc13" describes the CI leg it was written for, not a compiler constraint.

### 3. `postgresql-setup --initdb` leaves host auth on `ident`

Needed only if you want the server suite's `[pg]` tests to actually run. RHEL's initdb writes:

```
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
```

`ident` rejects the password auth in `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`, and the failure surfaces as a
connection error deep inside the test run rather than as a config error. Change the two loopback
`all all` lines to `scram-sha-256` and `systemctl reload postgresql`. `setup-rhel9.sh
--with-postgres` does this, preserves the original as `pg_hba.conf.yuzu-orig`, and prints a warning
rather than editing silently.

Remember the skip-vs-fail contract from `CLAUDE.md`: `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` **unset** → the `[pg]`
tests skip cleanly; **set but broken** → hard FAIL. So a misconfigured cluster is worse than none.

### 4. The test role needs `pg_signal_backend`, not just `CREATEDB`

This one cost a 600-second timeout to find, and it is the least obvious failure in this document.

`PostgresTestDb` creates an ephemeral `yuzu_test_<salt>_<n>` database per test and drops it
`WITH (FORCE)`. `FORCE` terminates the backends still attached to the database, and terminating
another role's backend requires membership in the predefined **`pg_signal_backend`** role. A test
role with only `LOGIN CREATEDB` gets:

```
PostgresTestDb: DROP DATABASE failed — leaked yuzu_test_1786828330_843575621_1284:
ERROR:  permission denied to terminate process
```

Nothing fails at that moment. The tests keep passing, each one leaking a database, and the cluster
gets progressively slower until the `server pg unit tests shard B` target blows its 600 s meson
timeout and is SIGKILLed — with the actual cause buried in thousands of lines of per-test `NOTICE:`
output. On the reference box this left **70 orphaned databases** behind.

```sql
GRANT pg_signal_backend TO yuzu;
```

`setup-rhel9.sh --with-postgres` grants it, `--check` verifies both the membership and that no
`yuzu_test_*` databases have leaked. If you are cleaning up after hitting this:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -tAc \
  "SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname LIKE 'yuzu\_test\_%'" |
  while read -r db; do
    [ -n "$db" ] && sudo -u postgres psql -qc "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS \"$db\" WITH (FORCE)"
  done
```

---

## RHEL vs Rocky vs Alma

The only material divergence is repository enablement. `ninja-build` lives in **CRB**
(CodeReady Builder, formerly PowerTools), which ships disabled on Rocky/Alma and is
subscription-gated on RHEL. (`ccache` is one repo further out - EPEL, not CRB; see below.)

| | Rocky 9 / Alma 9 | RHEL 9 |
|---|---|---|
| CRB | `sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb` | `sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-$(uname -m)-rpms` |
| Everything else | identical | identical |

**EPEL is not required to build.** Every *mandatory* package resolves from BaseOS / AppStream / CRB —
verified with `dnf repoquery --installed --qf '%{from_repo}'` on the reference box, which is also how
`docs/rhel9-toolchain-manifest.json` records provenance.

The one wrinkle: **`ccache` is EPEL-only** on this distro family. It is in neither BaseOS, AppStream
nor CRB (`ninja-build` *is* in CRB, which is easy to conflate). ccache is optional — without it the
build works, rebuilds are just slower — so `setup-rhel9.sh` installs it only if it is already
reachable, warns otherwise, and writes an env file whose `CC`/`CXX` adapt:

```bash
export CC="ccache gcc"   # if ccache is on PATH
export CC="gcc"          # otherwise
```

Pass `--with-epel` to have the script enable EPEL and pick ccache up. It is off by default because
enabling EPEL on a managed work machine is a policy decision, not a build requirement. EPEL is also
where `mold` and Erlang live, if you later want either.

---

## What gets installed, and why

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
  gcc-toolset-14 \
  cmake ninja-build pkgconf-pkg-config make \
  bison flex autoconf automake libtool \
  perl perl-IPC-Cmd perl-FindBin perl-File-Compare perl-Pod-Html \
  systemd-devel glibc-devel kernel-headers \
  python3-pip zip unzip tar git

sudo dnf install -y ccache          # optional, EPEL only — see above
```

`curl` is deliberately not in that list: stock RHEL-family images ship `curl-minimal`, which already
provides the `curl` binary vcpkg needs, and installing the full `curl` package on top of it is a
package conflict that aborts `dnf`. The script adds `curl` only when no `curl` binary exists at all.

| Package(s) | Why |
|---|---|
| `gcc-toolset-14` | C++23. See trap 1. |
| `cmake` | Not a build system here — Meson's `dependency(..., method: 'cmake')` resolution needs it, which is how gRPC/protobuf/SQLite/PostgreSQL/Catch2 are all found. |
| `ninja-build` | Meson's backend (CRB). |
| `bison`, `flex` | vcpkg's `libpq` port builds PostgreSQL from source and cannot auto-acquire these on Linux. |
| `perl` + `perl-IPC-Cmd`, `perl-FindBin`, `perl-File-Compare`, `perl-Pod-Html` | vcpkg's `openssl` port is a Perl-driven build. A minimal RHEL install has no `perl` at all. |
| `systemd-devel` | `agents/core/meson.build` takes a **required** `libsystemd` dependency (`systemd_guard` defaults to `enabled` in `meson.options`). The RHEL name for CI's `libsystemd-dev`. Opt out with `-Dsystemd_guard=disabled` if you must. |
| `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool` | Needed by several vcpkg ports (grpc/c-ares, xmlsec, libpq's autoreconf path). |
| `glibc-devel`, `kernel-headers` | RHEL equivalent of CI's `linux-libc-dev`. |
| `ccache` | **Optional, EPEL-only.** `CC`/`CXX` are set to `ccache gcc` / `ccache g++` when present (matching CI), plain `gcc`/`g++` otherwise. |

**Do not install `meson` from dnf** — Rocky/RHEL 9 ship 0.63.3, below the `meson_version: '>=1.3.0'`
floor in `meson.build`. Meson comes from pip, pinned to the CI version:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user meson==1.11.2 pyyaml==6.0.3
```

The system Python 3.9 is fine (meson 1.11.2 declares `requires_python >= 3.7`). PyYAML is a **hard
configure-time dependency** — `server/core/meson.build` runs `python3 -c 'import yaml'` and
hard-errors if it fails, because content embedding (`embed_content.py`) needs it. The rpm
`python3-pyyaml` (5.4.1) would work; the pinned 6.0.3 in `~/.local` shadows it and matches
`requirements-ci.in`.

> Do not install the hash-pinned `requirements-ci.txt` here — it was `pip-compile`d under Python
> 3.12, so `--require-hashes` under Python 3.9 is a needless wheel-selection risk. Install the two
> packages that matter explicitly. (`gcovr` from that file is only for the nightly coverage job.)

### Python 3.9 has a shelf life here

`meson setup` emits:

```
NOTICE: You are using Python 3.9 which is EOL. Starting with v1.12.0, Meson will require Python 3.10 or newer
```

Meson 1.11.2 works fine on 3.9 today, so this recipe stays on the system interpreter. When the
project moves past meson 1.11.x, RHEL 9 boxes will need a newer interpreter from AppStream
(`python3.12` is packaged). Two things to get right at that point:

1. Install meson under the new interpreter — `python3.12 -m pip install --user meson==<ver>`.
2. **PyYAML must be importable by whatever `python3` *meson* resolves**, which is a separate
   question. `find_program('python3')` picks up `/usr/bin/python3` (3.9) unless you shadow it, and
   that is the interpreter that runs `embed_content.py` and `gen_proto.py`. Installing meson under
   3.12 while leaving PyYAML only under 3.9, or vice versa, produces a confusing configure-time
   failure.

   Simplest resolution: keep PyYAML installed for *both* interpreters, or put `python3.12` first on
   `PATH` as `python3` so meson and the build scripts agree.

**Do not install `libpq-devel`** — libpq comes from vcpkg as a static library, and CI asserts the
built binary has no dynamic libpq (ADR-0008).

---

## vcpkg

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git ~/vcpkg
git -C ~/vcpkg checkout "$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('vcpkg.json'))['builtin-baseline'])")"
~/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
export VCPKG_ROOT=~/vcpkg
```

The baseline is read from `vcpkg.json` rather than written out here on purpose. The same SHA also
appears as `default-registry.baseline` in `vcpkg-configuration.json` and `VCPKG_COMMIT` in `ci.yml`,
and `.github/workflows/vcpkg-baseline-update.yml` rewrites every tracked copy when the baseline moves
— a list that `deploy/windows/Test-ToolchainContract.ps1` enforces against a repo-wide `git grep`. A
literal SHA in this file would be an untracked copy that silently goes stale, and would fail that
check. `scripts/setup-rhel9.sh` reads it the same way.

**Activate gcc-toolset before the first `vcpkg install`** so every port is built by GCC 14 rather
than the system GCC 11. Budget for a cold from-source build of all 22 ports (grpc, protobuf, abseil,
openssl, libpq, libxml2, xmlsec, sqlite3, zlib, catch2 …) and roughly 15–25 GB of
`buildtrees`/`packages` churn; see `docs/rhel9-toolchain-manifest.json` for measured timings on the
reference box.

---

## Environment

`setup-rhel9.sh` writes a sourceable `~/.config/yuzu/toolchain-env.sh` and hooks it into `~/.bashrc`
behind a guard block, so it is safe on re-run:

```bash
source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-14/enable   # guarded: no stacked PATH entries
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"          # meson
export VCPKG_ROOT="$HOME/vcpkg"
export CC="ccache gcc" CXX="ccache g++"
export YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN="postgresql://yuzu:yuzu@127.0.0.1:5432/yuzu_test"   # --with-postgres only, once verified
```

The DSN line is written only by a `--with-postgres` run, and only after the cluster has answered on
that exact DSN - the skip-vs-fail contract above means an exported-but-unreachable DSN would turn
every `[pg]` test from a clean skip into a hard failure. The file is regenerated from the flags of
the *most recent* run, so a later run without `--with-postgres` drops the DSN again (the tests then
skip - the safe direction); keep passing the flag. `YUZU_TEST_ENABLE_PG` is a compile-time define in
`tests/meson.build`, not an environment variable, so the file does not export it.

The DSN address/role/database match the native-cluster branch of `scripts/ci/ensure-postgres.sh`, so
that script is a no-op on a box provisioned this way. The `yuzu` role needs **`CREATEDB`** —
`PostgresTestDb` (`tests/unit/test_helpers.hpp`) creates and drops an ephemeral
`yuzu_test_<salt>_<n>` database per test. The script logs in with the DSN's own credentials before
deciding: a pre-existing `yuzu` role that lacks `LOGIN`, `CREATEDB`, or the `yuzu` password is
repaired with `ALTER ROLE` rather than accepted on its name.

---

## Verify

```bash
bash scripts/setup-rhel9.sh --check --with-postgres    # every gate below, scripted
```

Manually:

```bash
g++ --version                      # 14.2.1
meson --version                    # 1.11.2
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.__version__)"
printf '#include <print>\nint main(){std::println("c++23 ok");}\n' > /tmp/c23.cpp
g++ -std=c++23 /tmp/c23.cpp -o /tmp/c23 && /tmp/c23     # proves libstdc++ 14 is in play
psql "$YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN" -tAc 'SELECT 1'
```

After the build:

```bash
bash scripts/link-tests.sh          # see note below
meson test -C build-linux --print-errorlogs
```

> `scripts/setup.sh` calls `link-tests.sh` itself, but it does so at *configure* time — before the
> test binaries exist — so on a fresh checkout that call legitimately links nothing ("skipped N

Confirm the PG-backed tests really ran rather than skipped:

```bash
tests-build-server-linux_x64/yuzu_server_tests "[pg]"
```

## Verified reference run

Rocky Linux 9.8, 16 cores / 23 GB RAM, `dev` at `c01493d3`, 2026-08-15. The same recipe was also run
end-to-end on `main` at `88f9397d` (the 0.13.0 cut, meson 1.11.1) with the same outcome. Full
provenance — every package version with the repo it came from — is in
`docs/rhel9-toolchain-manifest.json`; everything above `verified_run` in that file is machine-collected
by `--manifest`, and the `verified_run` block is hand-recorded from the session.

| Stage | Result |
|---|---|
| `vcpkg install` (22 ports, **cold**) + `meson setup` | **20.3 min** — grpc 13 min, protobuf 2.8 min, openssl 46 s, abseil 40 s |
| `vcpkg install` (warm) + `meson setup --wipe` | **5 s** |
| `meson compile` (78 targets) | **4.7 min**, 523 warnings, none from vcpkg headers, `werror=false` |
| `meson test` (23 targets) | **10.4 min** — 18 pass, 2 skip, 2 fail (below) |
| libpq linkage (ADR-0008) | no dynamic libpq ✅ |
| Erlang gateway | skipped, rebar3 absent — by design |

The repo's own "~65–70 min cold vcpkg" estimate is calibrated for a smaller machine; 16 cores cut it
to 20 minutes.

> **Timeout headroom:** even when healthy, `server pg unit tests shard B` takes **523 s against a
> 600 s meson timeout** on this box. On a slower machine, raise the timeout rather than assuming a
> hang — but check trap 4 first, because a missing `pg_signal_backend` produces a *real* timeout.

### Two remaining failures

**1. `docs — yuzu:ci telemetry selftest`** — the system-SQLite/`RETURNING` limitation described
above. Platform-specific, understood, not fixable from the setup script.

**2. `tests/unit/server/test_mcp_server.cpp:4474`** (dev; `:2270` on main — the case moves between
commits, so match it by name) — *"MCP Agentic demo: classify schema drops phantom mode and never
steers to a write tool (G-S5/G-S6)"*, `CHECK(checked)`. One case out of 500 in shard A; one assertion
out of 9916.

**This is [issue #2610](https://github.com/Tr3kkR/Yuzu/issues/2610), not a RHEL problem** — a known
Linux-only deterministic failure where `classify_operational_question` is missing from `tools/list`
in a readonly session. It was first seen on WSL2/gcc and passes on Windows MSVC at the same commit.

This box supplied the issue's stated first triage step ("run the case on dev HEAD on any Linux box"),
on an independent distro and compiler: it fails on **`dev` @ `c01493d3`** and on **`main` @
`88f9397d`** under Rocky 9.8 / GCC 14.2.1, and reproduces with and without the Postgres test
environment. So it **does** pre-exist on dev, and the platform split is Linux-vs-Windows rather than
anything specific to the RHEL family.

---

## Known limitation: system SQLite is too old for the Python test tooling

RHEL 9 ships **SQLite 3.34.1** (`sqlite-libs-3.34.1`). The `RETURNING` clause landed in **3.35.0**.
The system `python3`'s `sqlite3` module links that system library, so any repo Python tooling that
uses `RETURNING` fails on a stock RHEL 9 box:

```
test_db: SQLite operational error on .../test-runs.db: near "RETURNING": syntax error
```

Concretely this fails the `docs — yuzu:ci telemetry selftest` meson test, and it means
`scripts/test/test_db.py` — the durable test-runs database behind the `/test` skill and the CI
telemetry — cannot record results on this platform.

**Scope: Python only.** The C++ build and test suites are unaffected — they link SQLite **3.52.0**
from vcpkg, not the system library. Nothing about the compiler, the build, or the C++ tests depends
on this.

Installing `python3.11` or `python3.12` from AppStream does **not** fix it — those RPMs link the same
system `sqlite-libs` (their dependency is literally `sqlite-libs >= 3.34.1`). A real fix means a
newer SQLite for Python (source build, or reworking the tooling onto a bundled driver), so on RHEL 9
today this is a documented limitation rather than something the setup script can resolve.

---

## Out of scope

- **The Erlang gateway.** `meson.build` does `find_program('rebar3', required: false)`, so with no
  rebar3 on `PATH` the configure step prints `Erlang gateway: skipped` and the C++ build proceeds
  normally; the `gateway eunit` / `gateway ct` meson tests simply never register. EPEL has Erlang
  26, but CI pins **OTP 28 + rebar3 3.24**, and `scripts/ensure-erlang.sh` only *finds* an existing
  kerl/asdf/brew install — it never downloads one. Adding the gateway means kerl or asdf for OTP 28
  plus a downloaded rebar3 3.24 escript. See `docs/erlang-gateway-build.md`.
- **The UAT rigs.** No container runtime is installed. `podman` + `podman-docker` are available in
  AppStream if you later want `scripts/start-UAT.sh` et al.; `scripts/ci/ensure-postgres.sh` prefers
  a `docker` binary but falls through to the native cluster this recipe provisions.
- **Sanitizer / coverage builds.** `-Db_sanitize=...` works with gcc-toolset-14; the nightly coverage
  job additionally needs `gcovr==8.6`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `meson.build:1: ERROR: Meson version is 0.63.3 but project requires >=1.3.0` | dnf's meson is on `PATH` ahead of `~/.local/bin`. Source the env file. |
| `ERROR: PyYAML is required to embed bundled content` at configure time | `python3` resolved to an interpreter without PyYAML. Check `python3 -c 'import yaml'` with the *same* `python3` meson found. |
| `ERROR: Unknown compiler(s): [['gcc-14']]` | You passed `--native-file meson/native/linux-gcc14.ini`. Use `linux-gcc13.ini`. See trap 2. |
| `cannot find -lmold` / `unrecognized option '-fuse-ld=mold'` | You passed the gcc15 or clang21 native file. See trap 2. |
| `error: 'print' is not a member of 'std'` | gcc-toolset not activated — you are on the system GCC 11. `source /opt/rh/gcc-toolset-14/enable`. |
| `FATAL: Ident authentication failed for user "yuzu"` | `pg_hba.conf` trap 3. |
| `server pg unit tests shard B` TIMEOUT / SIGKILL after 600 s | Missing `pg_signal_backend`, trap 4. Check for leaked `yuzu_test_*` databases. |
| `permission denied to terminate process` in test output | Same — trap 4. |
| `near "RETURNING": syntax error` from a Python script | System SQLite is 3.34.1; `RETURNING` needs 3.35+. Known limitation, see above. |
| `[fail] sudo is required` | Stock container images and minimal installs have no `sudo`. As root: `dnf install -y sudo`. |
| vcpkg `openssl` port fails in `Configure` | Missing perl modules. Install `perl-IPC-Cmd perl-FindBin perl-File-Compare perl-Pod-Html`. |
| vcpkg `libpq` port fails looking for `bison`/`flex` | Those two packages are not installed. |
