# Yuzu Codebase Conformance Audit — Code vs. Documented Intent

> **Comparison of the codebase against the *intent* recorded in its documents** (ADRs, CLAUDE.md routed concerns, WIRED/SHIPPED status markers, user manuals, capability-map/roadmap).

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | `feat/postgres-f3-flip` |
| HEAD | `1f375f29` |
| Date | 2026-06-18 |
| Method | 17-domain multi-agent fan-out; each claim statically verified + adversarially re-checked by an independent skeptic; behavioral claims confirmed against a live Postgres-flipped stack (Phase 3 UAT) |
| Claims audited | **388** |
| Confirmed | **340 (87%)** |
| Non-confirmed (drift) | **48** |

## 1. Result at a glance

**By intent tier**

| Tier | Meaning | Claims | Confirmed | Drift |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|
| A | Architectural law (ADR / routed-concern) | 201 | 189 | 12 |
| B | Aspirational (capability-map/roadmap) | 20 | 6 | 14 |
| C | Current-state WIRED/SHIPPED claim | 77 | 68 | 9 |
| D | User-manual behavioral spec | 90 | 77 | 13 |

**Drift by severity:** HIGH=1, MEDIUM=15, LOW=31 (+ 1 unsettled/UNVERIFIABLE)

**Drift by direction:** `doc-ahead-of-code`=25, `code-ahead-of-doc`=16, `contradiction`=6, `none`=1

**Headline.** The codebase is **highly faithful to its binding intent** — 87% of claims confirmed, and **Tier-A architectural law (ADRs + routed concerns) holds at 189/201**. The dominant drift pattern is the *opposite* of the usual failure mode: **the docs lag behind the code** (`code-ahead-of-doc` + the bulk of `doc-ahead-of-code` are Tier-B capability-map entries that mark *shipped* features "Not implemented"). The single systemic exception worth code attention is the cluster of MCP/audit invariant gaps and one dangerous **user-manual contradiction** (auth-18) that documents a privilege-escalation path the code deliberately refuses.

## 2. Phase 3 — Live UAT evidence (Postgres-flipped stack)

Booted the **native `feat/postgres-f3-flip` server binary** (`build-macos/server/core/yuzu-server`, built 2026-06-18 08:25) against a throwaway `yuzu-postgres:local` container. Behavioral confirmation of the dominant architectural cluster:

| Check | Result | Substantiates |
|---|---|---|
| Boot **without** DSN | `[PG] Refusing to start: no PostgreSQL DSN. Set --postgres-dsn / YUZU_POSTGRES_DSN (ADR-0006/0007 …)` → `run(): refusing to serve` → shutdown | **Fail-closed** (ADR-0007); asp-07/asp-16/ci-15 (parity-plan "SQLite zero-ops" is false) |
| Boot **with** DSN | `/healthz` 302, `/readyz` `{"status":"ready"}` | server runs on Postgres; `pg_pool` in `/readyz` conjunction |
| `/metrics` | `yuzu_pg_pool_{size=16,open=1,in_use=0,waiters=0}` + `yuzu_pg_acquire_wait_seconds` histogram | #1368 `PgPool::Observer` metrics wired |
| Postgres schema | `public.schema_meta` row `endpoint_state\|1`; table `endpoint_state.endpoints` | ADR-0008 shared meta + schema-per-store; born-on-PG `OfflineEndpointStore` via `PgMigrationRunner` |
| `yuzu_fleet_perf_*` (dex-21) | wired at `agent_registry.cpp:1478-1481` | resolved static (was UNVERIFIABLE) |
| executions drawer stamps (instr-22) | `workflow_routes.cpp:190` emits `data-execution-id`; `instruction_ui.cpp:765` binds | resolved static (was UNVERIFIABLE) |

## 3. Drift findings (48)

Ordered by severity, then domain. `direction`: `doc-ahead-of-code` = claimed but not built · `code-ahead-of-doc` = built but doc stale · `contradiction` = code does what the doc forbids (or vice-versa) · `superseded-decision` = reality outgrew an ADR.

### `asp-03` · HIGH · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/capability-map.md:1163-1171 (§31.2)
**Claim:** Event Guards — Kernel-Event-Driven Enforcement (Windows) §31.2 is :x: Not implemented (PRs 3, 5, 6, 7, 10). Registry Guard, SCM Guard, WFP Guard, ETW Guard listed as roadmap.
**Evidence:** guard_registry.cpp exists (start() at line 239 with enforcement logic, enforce-mode recreate at line 310, non-Windows no-op stub at line 545). guard_file.cpp exists (FileGuard::start() at line 84 with Windows implementation, no-op stub at line 457). guard_service.cpp exists. guardian_engine.cpp:516-705 wires FileGuard (line 536), ServiceGuard (line 602), and RegistryGuard (line 660) into the engine. WFP Guard and ETW Guard are absent (no guard_wfp* or guard_etw* files). So Registry + File + SCM guards ARE shipped, making this PARTIAL not :x:.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. capability-map.md:1163-1171 (§31.2 "Event Guards — Kernel-Event-Driven Enforcement (Windows)") is marked :x: "Not implemented (PRs 3, 5, 6, 7, 10)" and lists four primitives. Three are in fact shipped and wired into the production agent: (1) Registry Guard — RegistryGuard using RegNotifyChangeKeyValue + WaitForMultipleObjects (agents/core/src/guard_registry.cpp:456,468,522) with enforce-mode key recreate/write-back (RegCreateKeyExW, line 319), wired in guardian_engine.cpp:660-709; (2) SCM Guard — ServiceGuard using NotifyServiceStatusChangeW + OpenSCManagerW/OpenServiceW (guard_service.cpp:347-449), wired in guardian_engine.cpp:598-658, git commit e841be56 "real-time Windows service run-state enforcement (PR5)"; (3) File Guard — FileGuard using ReadDirectoryChangesW + FindFirstChangeNotificationW (guard_file.cpp:176,309), wired in guardian_engine.cpp:516-596. All four guard sources are in agents/core/meson.build:41 and compiled into the agent. Only WFP Guard and ETW Guard remain genuinely absent (no guard_wfp*/guard_etw* sources exist outside unrelated TAR/network code). The section should therefore be :large_orange_diamond: Partial (3 of 4 named primitives shipped), not :x:. (Note: the drift direction is code-ahead-of-doc — the doc under-states shipped work — not the auditor's stated "doc-ahead-of-code"; but the drift itself is real and material.) I could not find any code or doc text that satisfies the :x: Not-implemented claim, so the finding stands.
**Recommended record update:** none

### `agent-12` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · contradiction
**Domain:** Agent core, plugins, privilege, OS matrix (Tier A)
**Source:** docs/os-capability-matrix.md line 29: "DEX — performance telemetry (CPU/mem/disk levels) | Windows ✅ | Linux ✅ | macOS ⛔ | tar_perf.cpp (Win: GetSystemTimes...; Linux: /proc)"
**Claim:** tar_perf.cpp is the source of truth for DEX perf telemetry and implements Linux (/proc) collection (Linux ✅).
**Evidence:** tar_perf.cpp:190 `#else // !_WIN32 — Linux (/proc) and macOS (host_statistics) are kPlanned`; read_perf_counters() returns empty PerfCounters with valid=false on BOTH Linux and macOS (lines 194-198). The machine-readable source-of-truth tar_schema_registry.cpp:296 marks perf source `OsSupportStatus::kPlanned` for linux (and :298 macos), only :291 windows kSupported. The cited source-of-truth file does NOT deliver Linux perf.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Confirmed drift. The matrix row docs/os-capability-matrix.md:29 ("DEX — performance telemetry (CPU/mem/disk levels)") cites `tar_perf.cpp` as its source of truth, marks Linux ✅, and says "Linux: /proc". The cited file does NOT deliver this on Linux: agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_perf.cpp:190-198 — the non-Windows `read_perf_counters()` returns `PerfCounters` with valid=false and the inline comment "collect_perf records nothing on this platform yet". The file's own header agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_perf.hpp:18 states "Linux (/proc) and macOS (host_statistics) are kPlanned in the registry." The machine-readable source of truth tar_schema_registry.cpp:296 marks the `perf` source OsSupportStatus::kPlanned for linux (only :291 windows kSupported), and tar_plugin.cpp:725 emits `unsupported_platform` when the read is invalid. The Linux /proc perf code that DOES exist (agents/core/src/dex_linux_collector.cpp poll_perf at :243 + dex_linux_proc.cpp parse_proc_stat/parse_commit_pct/parse_diskstats) belongs to a DIFFERENT capability — it produces sustained-breach DEX reliability SIGNALS (cpu_sustained/memory_pressure/disk_latency observations, the matrix's line-28 "DEX — reliability signals" row), not the continuous BRD-A1 device performance-level warehouse tier ($Perf_Live/$Perf_Hourly) that tar_perf.cpp owns and line 29 describes. So no source satisfies the "Linux ✅" claim for the row as cited.

### `asp-02` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/capability-map.md:1076-1078 (§28.3)
**Claim:** Response Offloading (§28.3) is :x: Not implemented. 'Configure external HTTP endpoints to receive response data in real time. OffloadTarget model with auth, event filtering, and batch delivery.'
**Evidence:** §20.7 (capability-map.md:848-850) marks the exact same capability DONE with OffloadTargetStore, batch_size, typed auth (none/bearer/basic/hmac), CRLF-guarded headers, REST CRUD at /api/v1/offload-targets, and wiring in agent_service_impl.cpp (agent.registered and execution.completed events). offload_routes.cpp line 1 and offload_target_store.cpp line 1 confirm existence. Roadmap 8.3 is also Done. §28.3 and §20.7 describe the same feature; §28.3 has not been updated.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed. The documented claim in docs/capability-map.md:1076-1078 (§28.3) marks Response Offloading as ":x: Not implemented", but the feature is fully shipped in code. Verified independently: server/core/src/offload_target_store.hpp:33-90 defines OffloadAuthType {None,Bearer,Basic,Hmac} and the OffloadTarget model (name/url/auth_type/auth_credential/event_types/batch_size/enabled); offload_target_store.cpp implements typed auth header construction (lines 583-591), CRLF-guard rationale on auth_credential (lines 248-251), batching (build_batch_body line 519, per-target batch_size dispatch line 668), and credential-omitting reads. REST CRUD is registered in offload_routes.cpp at /api/v1/offload-targets (GET list :66, POST create :84, GET one :136, DELETE :158, GET deliveries :197) gated by perm_fn. Wiring into agent_service_impl.cpp fires offload events for agent.registered (line 516) and execution.completed (lines 1239, 1470). This exactly matches the §20.7 entry (capability-map.md:848-850) which correctly marks the SAME capability DONE. §28.3 is an internal contradiction with §20.7 and is the stale/incorrect entry — doc-ahead-of-code (doc understates implemented reality). Auditor evidence independently corroborated; I did not rely on it.

### `asp-05` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/capability-map.md:1137-1151 (§30.1-§30.4)
**Claim:** All four Scope Walking and Result Set capabilities (§30.1-§30.4) are :x: Not implemented.
**Evidence:** result_set_store.cpp (857 lines) implements ResultSetStore with create_pending (line 373), list_by_owner (line 381), lineage (line 466), pin/unpin (lines 634/662), GC sweep, per-owner quotas. rest_api_v1.cpp has 10+ /api/v1/result-sets routes (GET, POST, from-inventory-query, from-tar-query, from-instruction-result, re-eval, members, lineage, pin, unpin, delete — lines 3135-3570). scope_engine.cpp:420-434 implements from_result_set: short-circuit kind. result_sets_ui.cpp (render_result_sets_sidebar, render_result_set_detail, from_result_set token display). result_set_matcher.cpp exists. CHANGELOG (~line 1194-1234) confirms these shipped. §30.1, §30.2, and §30.3 should be DONE; §30.4 operational hardening is PARTIAL (metrics present, full GC/re-eval in code).
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift is real. The doc (capability-map.md:1137-1151) marks all four §30 capabilities as ":x: Not implemented," but the code substantively implements all four and they are wired into the running server. §30.1: ResultSetStore (server/core/src/result_set_store.cpp, 857 lines — insert/list_by_owner:381, lineage with cycle guard:466, gc_sweep:827, pin/unpin, per-owner quotas) is instantiated in server/core/src/server.cpp:1734-1736 against result_sets.db and is part of /readyz (server.cpp:4372). §30.2: from_result_set:<id-or-alias> short-circuit scope kind in scope_engine.cpp:420-434, resolved at dispatch (server.cpp:5318), membership preload in agent_registry.cpp:1102-1155, sidebar/breadcrumb in result_sets_ui.cpp. §30.3: fromResultSet: YAML validation with the exact documented combo rules in instruction_store.cpp:392-412 (validate_definition_scope, rejects fromResultSet+managementGroups and fromResultSet+dynamic, deferred dispatch-time resolution) for InstructionDefinition/InstructionSet. §30.4: gc_sweep, POST /api/v1/result-sets/{id}/re-eval (rest_api_v1.cpp:3428), and Prometheus metrics yuzu_result_sets_total / yuzu_result_set_quota_rejected with 429 quota rejection (rest_api_v1.cpp:3069-3122). CHANGELOG.md:1191-1233 explicitly documents these as shipped across PRs C/D/E. The only incompleteness is policy-level fromResultSet, which is explicitly gated as "not yet supported for policies" (policy_store.cpp:684) — a minor sub-surface gap that does not rescue an "all four Not implemented" claim. Direction is doc-ahead-of-code (doc understates shipped reality).
**Recommended record update:** none

### `asp-07` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/enterprise-parity-plan.md:16
**Claim:** Architecture comparison table: 'Server Database | SQL Server (multiple DBs) | SQLite (embedded, WAL mode)'. Yuzu stated advantage: 'No SQL Server dependency — SQLite is embedded, zero-ops'.
**Evidence:** server.cpp:929-944 constructs a PgPool, fails closed on empty/unreachable postgres_dsn with '[PG] Refusing to start' log token. CHANGELOG [Unreleased] states 'BREAKING — the server now runs on PostgreSQL (ADR-0006/0007)... there is no SQLite fallback for the server.' offline_endpoint_store.cpp line 5 includes pg/pg_pool.hpp and line 58 takes PgPool& constructor. The server now REQUIRES PostgreSQL; the 'zero-ops SQLite' claim is no longer accurate for any server deployment.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. docs/enterprise-parity-plan.md:16 still lists 'Server Database | ... | SQLite (embedded, WAL mode)' and line 30 (repeated at line 632) claims 'No SQL Server dependency — SQLite is embedded, zero-ops' as a standing Yuzu advantage, with NO acknowledgment of the Postgres flip anywhere in the doc. The code contradicts this: server.cpp:937-941 logs '[PG] Refusing to start' and sets startup_failed_=true when postgres_dsn is empty, and server.cpp:964-967 fails closed when the database is unreachable — there is no SQLite fallback for the server substrate. CHANGELOG.md:12 confirms 'BREAKING — the server now runs on PostgreSQL (ADR-0006/0007) ... there is no SQLite fallback for the server.' The first born-on-Postgres store is real: offline_endpoint_store.cpp:5 includes pg/pg_pool.hpp and offline_endpoint_store.cpp:58's constructor takes pg::PgPool&. The 'zero-ops embedded SQLite, no SQL Server dependency' claim is now categorically false — the server has a hard PostgreSQL dependency and refuses to boot without it.
**Recommended record update:** none

### `asp-08` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/enterprise-parity-plan.md:5
**Claim:** Document baseline: 'Yuzu v0.7.0, 165/184 capabilities done'.
**Evidence:** Capability map (docs/capability-map.md:35) shows current count at 169/228 done overall. The enterprise-parity-plan uses an older capability count (184 total vs 228 total now) and an older version number. The document predates Phase 8+ features, scope walking, Guardian PRs, PostgreSQL substrate, DEX signals, and network quality dashboard. Version reference v0.7.0 is stale; the product has advanced materially.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed on three axes. (1) Version: enterprise-parity-plan.md:5 and :11 cite "Yuzu v0.7.0", but meson.build declares version: '0.12.0' (five minor versions ahead). (2) Capability count: the plan states "165/184 capabilities done" while the authoritative capability-map.md:35 shows "169/228 done (74%)" — total grew from 184 to 228 (44 Phase 8-16 capabilities added per capability-map.md:33) and done moved 165→169. (3) Architecture staleness: enterprise-parity-plan.md:16 still lists "Server Database = SQLite (embedded, WAL mode)", but CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] documents a BREAKING flip to PostgreSQL as the server substrate (the very change on this branch). The auditor's verdict holds; I verified each fact from source files rather than the cited evidence.
**Recommended record update:** none

### `asp-15` · MEDIUM · PARTIAL · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/enterprise-readiness-soc2-first-customer.md §3.2 and docs/capability-map.md §18.10
**Claim:** Workstream B requires '2FA/TOTP for high-risk approvals'. Capability map §18.10 states not implemented.
**Evidence:** totp.cpp and totp.hpp exist. auth_db.cpp:489-521 adds mfa_totp_secret BLOB, mfa_enrolled_at, mfa_last_counter columns, mfa_recovery_codes table in schema v2 migration. auth_db.cpp:1221 implements mfa_init_enrollment(), mfa_verify_enrollment(). rest_api_v1.cpp:805 defines StepUpFn; step_up_fn is wired into token creation (line 1325), deletion (line 1477), session revocation (line 1660), software packages (line 3806), guaranteed-state rules (line 4299). The SOC2 doc says this requirement is open; it is more advanced than claimed — TOTP infrastructure and step-up integration are present. What remains is completing the MFA enrollment UI and audit evidence.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift is real and I could not refute it. capability-map.md §18.10 (line 780-782) flatly states "Two-Factor Authentication for Approvals :x: T2 — Not implemented." That status is false: TOTP/2FA is substantially shipped and wired into the build (server/core/meson.build:271-273 compiles totp.cpp, mfa_step_up.cpp, mfa_qr.cpp). Concretely: (a) full enrollment UI with server-rendered QR — settings_routes.cpp:786 render_mfa_fragment + routes /fragments/settings/mfa (4441), /api/settings/mfa/init|verify|disable|recovery-codes (4452-4536); (b) login MFA challenge + step-up endpoints — auth_routes.cpp:767 /login/mfa, 963 /login/mfa/enroll, 1134 /login/mfa/stepup; (c) a real (non-stub) step-up enforcement gate — mfa_step_up.cpp:16 require_mfa_step_up (fail-closed on store error, freshness window, OIDC amr handling) constructed in server.cpp:5005 with live config cfg_.mfa_step_up_window_secs / cfg_.mfa_enforcement and applied to high-risk REST endpoints (rest_api_v1.cpp:1325 tokens, 1660 sessions, 3806 software-packages, 3979 software-deployments/start, 4299 guaranteed-state rules, 4632 push) and settings user-management (settings_routes.cpp:3450, 3538); (d) CLI flags --mfa-enforcement and --mfa-step-up-window-secs (main.cpp:257,266) with optional/required/admin-only modes; (e) schema (auth_db.cpp:489-523) and ops (mfa_init_enrollment/verify/status/recovery/disable). Two notes on the auditor's framing: the direction is doc-BEHIND-code (code is ahead of the doc), not "doc-ahead-of-code"; and the auditor's "what remains is the enrollment UI" is wrong — the enrollment UI exists. The only genuine gaps vs §18.10's narrow wording are instruction-approval-workflow-specific gating and the email-OTP fallback, neither of which is implemented — but that does not justify a blanket "Not implemented" status. The SOC2 doc §3.2 line 71 lists this only as a target "Required Feature/Control," which is defensible, but capability-map §18.10 is a factual error.
**Recommended record update:** none

### `asp-16` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/enterprise-parity-plan.md (architecture comparison, advantages section)
**Claim:** Yuzu advantage: 'No SQL Server dependency — SQLite is embedded, zero-ops'. The 'Yuzu Equivalent' column throughout references SQLite for response persistence, audit trail, etc.
**Evidence:** CHANGELOG [Unreleased] BREAKING entry: 'the server now runs on PostgreSQL (ADR-0006/0007)... operator action: provision a reachable PostgreSQL... and set YUZU_POSTGRES_DSN before upgrading.' server.cpp:937-938 emits '[PG] Refusing to start: no PostgreSQL DSN'. OfflineEndpointStore is already Postgres-native. The enterprise-parity-plan's competitive advantage claim of 'zero-ops embedded SQLite' is now inaccurate for the server component — operators must provision and manage a PostgreSQL instance. The agent remains SQLite.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. docs/enterprise-parity-plan.md asserts the competitive advantage "No SQL Server dependency — SQLite is embedded, zero-ops" at line 30 (and again at line 16 "Server Database ... SQLite (embedded, WAL mode)" and line 632 "SQLite (embedded, zero-ops)"), with SQLite referenced throughout the "Yuzu Equivalent" column (lines 74, 233, 249, 286, 326). The server code contradicts this: server.cpp:937-941 emits "[PG] Refusing to start: no PostgreSQL DSN ... the server requires Postgres" and sets startup_failed_ when cfg_.postgres_dsn is empty; server.cpp:964-967 also fails closed when the database is unreachable — there is explicitly no SQLite fallback (comment at server.cpp:931). OfflineEndpointStore is born-on-Postgres (server.cpp:985-992). CHANGELOG.md:12 documents this as a live "BREAKING — the server now runs on PostgreSQL (ADR-0006/0007)" requiring operators to provision and set YUZU_POSTGRES_DSN before upgrading. The "zero-ops embedded SQLite" advantage is therefore inaccurate for the server; only the agent remains SQLite. Could not refute.
**Recommended record update:** none

### `auth-18` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · contradiction
**Domain:** Auth / RBAC / sessions / tokens (Tier D)
**Source:** docs/user-manual/authentication.md "Group-to-Role Mapping": "If the OIDC user's email or display name matches a local admin account, they are also granted admin regardless of group membership."
**Claim:** OIDC grants admin if the user's email or display name matches a local admin account, regardless of group membership
**Evidence:** auth.cpp:782-789 create_oidc_session: "Security (C3 fix): Admin role via OIDC ONLY through explicit group membership. Do NOT match on email/display_name — these are attacker-controlled values." Role is admin ONLY if a group equals admin_group_id; no email/display-name path exists
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed independently. The doc at docs/user-manual/authentication.md:288 states: "If the OIDC user's email or display name matches a local admin account, they are also granted admin regardless of group membership." I traced the OIDC code path myself: the callback handler at server/core/src/auth_routes.cpp:1357-1400 extracts email/display from claims and passes them to create_oidc_session, performing NO email/display-name admin matching. In create_oidc_session (server/core/src/auth.cpp:782-793) the role is admin ONLY if a value in `groups` equals `admin_group_id`; there is no email/display-name path. An explicit C3 security-fix comment (auth.cpp:783-784) states admin via OIDC is ONLY through explicit group membership because email/display_name are "attacker-controlled values." No other caller or code site applies such a match. The doc describes a privilege-escalation fallback that the code deliberately does not implement — a direct contradiction.

### `auth-19` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · code-ahead-of-doc
**Domain:** Auth / RBAC / sessions / tokens (Tier D)
**Source:** docs/user-manual/authentication.md "API Tokens": "API tokens are always granted full admin-level access. RBAC scoping for API tokens is planned for a future release."
**Claim:** API tokens are always granted full admin-level access
**Evidence:** auth_routes.cpp:95-99 synthesize_token_session: "Resolve the creator's actual legacy role fresh (not unconditional admin)"; synth.role = get_user_role(principal_id).value_or(Role::user). A non-admin creator's token gets a user-role session, not admin
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. authentication.md:350 claims "API tokens are always granted full admin-level access." The code contradicts this: synthesize_token_session (server/core/src/auth_routes.cpp:88-102) sets synth.role = auth_mgr_.get_user_role(api_token.principal_id).value_or(auth::Role::user) — the token inherits the creator's CURRENT legacy role (auth.cpp:737-743 returns the stored per-user role: user or admin), defaulting to Role::user, NOT unconditional admin. Furthermore require_admin (auth_routes.cpp:153-194) explicitly returns 403 for service-scoped tokens (line 163), MCP-tier tokens (line 172), and any session where role != admin (line 182). So a non-admin creator's token, and all scoped/MCP tokens, are denied admin operations. There is no code path that grants every API token admin access; the doc is stale.

### `dex-17` · MEDIUM · PARTIAL · code-ahead-of-doc
**Domain:** DEX telemetry (Tier D)
**Source:** docs/dex-signal-catalog.md:396-401 — "keep dex_obs_platforms() in sync with these collectors" + Linux table rows marked "live"
**Claim:** The server-side per-OS coverage map dex_obs_platforms() attributes all shipped Linux collector signals to Linux.
**Evidence:** Linux agent collectors emit disk.error, fs.corruption, hw.error, os.bugcheck, os.dirty_shutdown, os.time_unsynced, service.hung, process.hung (dex_linux_kmsg/journal) + hw.cpu_throttled (sysfs) + perf.disk_latency_high (proc), but dex_routes.cpp:128-145 dex_obs_platforms() kLinux[] lists only 7 (perf.cpu_sustained, perf.memory_pressure, storage.low, os.uptime_report, process.crashed, service.crashed, memory.exhausted). The code comment l.133-140 acknowledges the gap is deliberate pending the #1523 batch.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The documented claim (docs/dex-signal-catalog.md:399-401: dex_obs_platforms() "gains the new Linux obs_types ... keep it in sync with these collectors", plus the Linux status table at lines 452-470 marking 17 obs_types as Linux signals) is NOT satisfied by the code. server/core/src/dex_routes.cpp:128-132 kLinux[] lists only 7 obs_types (perf.cpu_sustained, perf.memory_pressure, storage.low, os.uptime_report, process.crashed, service.crashed, memory.exhausted). The other 10 Linux signals the doc attributes to Linux are NOT in the map: perf.disk_latency_high, hw.cpu_throttled, service.hung, os.time_unsynced, os.bugcheck, os.dirty_shutdown, disk.error, fs.corruption, hw.error, process.hung. Critically, the code comment at dex_routes.cpp:133-140 justifies the omission by claiming these "land WITH their collectors in the dex-linux-signals batch (#1523)" — but the collectors ARE present and shipped on this branch: dex_linux_kmsg.cpp emits disk.error/fs.corruption/hw.error/os.bugcheck/os.dirty_shutdown/process.hung (verified via grep); dex_linux_journal.cpp emits os.time_unsynced/service.hung and routes _TRANSPORT=kernel lines through classify_kernel_message (journal.cpp:137-138); dex_linux_sysfs.cpp emits hw.cpu_throttled; dex_linux_proc emits perf.disk_latency_high. All are listed in agents/core/meson.build:41 (built) and wired into dex_linux_collector.cpp (includes dex_linux_sysfs.hpp/journal.hpp/proc.hpp; poll loop calls poll_journald() at line 223). So the deliberate-deferral comment is stale, the map under-attributes 10 of 17 Linux signals, and a real Linux fleet's /dex Catalogue would show those signals as not-Linux-collected — the exact "monitored, quiet reads as healthy" failure the comment itself warns against. Direction is code-ahead-of-doc-instruction: the map was never updated when the collectors landed.

### `gw-20` · MEDIUM · PARTIAL · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Gateway (Erlang) (Tier C)
**Source:** yuzu_gw_app.erl:119-144 stop/1 + docs/user-manual implied graceful drain: 'Stop accepting new commands via the router' on shutdown.
**Claim:** On shutdown the gateway tells the router to stop accepting new commands (RouterPid ! drain), then drains in-flight commands, then flushes the heartbeat buffer.
**Evidence:** yuzu_gw_app.erl:123-129 sends RouterPid ! drain, but yuzu_gw_router.erl has NO drain clause — grep 'drain' in the router returns nothing; the message falls through handle_info(_Info,State)->{noreply,State} (172-173) and is silently ignored. The router keeps accepting send_command during drain. drain_pending/1 (147-169) and flush_sync (137) DO work.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift is real. yuzu_gw_app.erl:127 sends `RouterPid ! drain`, with the comment at :122 "Stop accepting new commands via the router." But yuzu_gw_router.erl has NO clause matching `drain`: the message handlers are handle_call({send_command,...}) (line 60), handle_call(_Request,...) (115), handle_cast(_Msg,...) (118), handle_info({fanout_timeout,...}) (121), handle_info({fanout_terminal,...}) (144), and the catch-all handle_info(_Info, State) -> {noreply, State} (172-173). The plain `drain` term arrives as an info message and is silently swallowed at line 172. The router #state{} record (34-36) holds only `fanouts` — there is no draining flag, and handle_call({send_command,...}) (60) dispatches unconditionally with no drain check, so the router keeps accepting new commands throughout the 10s drain window. A repo-wide grep finds `drain` nowhere in the router module. Steps 2 (drain_pending/1, app.erl:147-169) and 3 (flush_sync, app.erl:137) do work as documented; only step 1 ("stop accepting new commands") is unimplemented. Direction is doc/comment-ahead-of-code.

### `mcp-03` · MEDIUM · DRIFTED · contradiction
**Domain:** MCP & agentic-first (A1-A4) (Tier A)
**Source:** CLAUDE.md routed-concern (MCP doc): "JObj/JArr output (never nlohmann::json output — parse only)"; docs/mcp-server.md Architecture: "nlohmann::json is used for parsing only"
**Claim:** MCP output serialization uses JObj/JArr string builders only; nlohmann::json is never used to serialize output (parse-only).
**Evidence:** list_issued_certs builds output via nlohmann::json items/payload and emits payload.dump() (mcp_server.cpp:2482-2510); revoke_certificate likewise (mcp_server.cpp:2580-2589). Both embed nlohmann-serialized JSON into the response text. Doc/CLAUDE invariant forbids nlohmann output.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. The documented invariant in docs/mcp-server.md:13 states "nlohmann::json is used for parsing only" (echoed by the CLAUDE.md MCP routed-concern "never nlohmann::json output"). However, two reachable, registered MCP tools build their RESPONSE payload with nlohmann::json and serialize it as output: list_issued_certs constructs `nlohmann::json items`/`nlohmann::json payload` and emits `payload.dump()` embedded as the response text content (server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:2482-2508), and revoke_certificate builds `nlohmann::json payload = {{"revoked",true},...}` and emits `payload.dump()` (server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:2580-2588). Both are confirmed registered tools (registration at lines 377/385, perm map 461/462, handlers at 2458/2525). The outer envelope uses JObj/JArr (the file uses that pattern in ~130 sites per the invariant), but the actual data payload the agentic client consumes is nlohmann-serialized output — a direct contradiction of the parse-only claim. I could not find any code path satisfying the documented claim for these two handlers. (Lines 2289/2328 are input/storage re-serialization, a separate gray area.)

**Source:** CLAUDE.md routed-concern (MCP doc): "audit-event shape"; docs/mcp-server.md Security Model: "Every MCP tool call logged with action: mcp.<tool_name> and mcp_tool field on AuditEvent"
**Claim:** Every MCP tool call is logged with action mcp.<tool_name> AND populates the mcp_tool field on AuditEvent.
**Evidence:** mcp_audit helper (mcp_server.cpp:798-800) calls audit_fn with action "mcp."+tool_name, target_type="mcp_tool", target_id=tool_name. AuthRoutes::audit_log (auth_routes.cpp:466-487) sets target_type/target_id but NEVER sets event.mcp_tool. Grep for '.mcp_tool =' across server/core/src/*.cpp returns no matches — the dedicated AuditEvent.mcp_tool column (audit_store.hpp:29) is always empty.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The documented claim has two parts; only the first holds. (1) Action IS set: every MCP tool call audits with action "mcp."+tool_name (server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:799). (2) The mcp_tool field is NEVER populated. The central audit chokepoint AuthRoutes::make_audit_event (server/core/src/auth_routes.cpp:442-459) and AuthRoutes::audit_log (server/core/src/auth_routes.cpp:466-487) set principal/role/action/result/source_ip/user_agent/session_id/target_type/target_id/detail but never event.mcp_tool. The MCP AuditFn signature (server/core/src/mcp_server.hpp:45-47) has no mcp_tool parameter; the call site routes tool_name into target_id and the literal string "mcp_tool" into target_type, NOT into the dedicated AuditEvent.mcp_tool field. The field is moreover not even a persisted column: the CREATE TABLE (server/core/src/audit_store.cpp:47-61) and 12-field INSERT (server/core/src/audit_store.cpp:91-94, binds 110-120) omit mcp_tool entirely. A repo-wide grep shows the only ".mcp_tool =" assignments are in hand-built test fixtures (tests/unit/server/test_mcp_server.cpp:319,475) that never exercise the real audit path; no production code sets it. So AuditEvent.mcp_tool (audit_store.hpp:29) is permanently empty and dead.

**Source:** docs/agentic-first-principle.md A4: "Every failure response — REST, MCP, gRPC — includes code, message, correlation_id, retry_after_ms, remediation"
**Claim:** MCP error responses carry the full A4 envelope (correlation_id, retry_after_ms, remediation).
**Evidence:** Only the dex-perf MCP tools emit A4 data (correlation_id + nullable retry_after_ms + remediation) via the a4_data helper (mcp_server.cpp:1952-1980, #1463 gate). All other MCP error sites use plain error_response (mcp_jsonrpc.hpp:113-127) carrying only code+message (+optional opaque data). Code comment at mcp_server.cpp:1950-1951 explicitly tracks the rest-of-MCP backfill under #1470.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The A4 rule (docs/agentic-first-principle.md:60-77) states universally that every MCP failure response "includes ... correlation_id, retry_after_ms, remediation" plus two specialisations (kPermissionDenied names securable_type:operation; kApprovalRequired returns approval_id + status_url). The code does NOT satisfy this for the MCP layer at large. Only the 4 dex-perf tools carry the A4 envelope, via the a4_data lambda + make_correlation_id() (server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:1952-2059), explicitly gated by #1463. All other ~80 MCP error sites use plain error_response(id, code, message) from mcp_jsonrpc.hpp:113-127, which emits only code+message (+ optional opaque data that is not the A4 envelope — e.g. the CA revoke site at mcp_server.cpp:2558-2561 emits {"audit_persisted":false}, not correlation_id/retry/remediation). The single kApprovalRequired site (mcp_server.cpp:834-840) returns only code+message — no approval_id or status_url specialisation; there is no kPermissionDenied site carrying the missing-permission specialisation at all. The developers themselves track the rest-of-MCP backfill in an in-code comment under #1470 (mcp_server.cpp:1946-1951). The auditor's cited evidence is all accurate.

**Claim:** ITServiceOwner is seeded with exactly the 10 listed securable types (50 permissions).
**Evidence:** server/core/src/rbac_store.cpp:401-435 seeds 16 securable types (Infrastructure, InstructionDefinition, InstructionSet, Execution, Schedule, Approval, Tag, AuditLog, Response, ManagementGroup, Policy, DeviceToken, SoftwareDeployment, License, FileRetrieval, GuaranteedState) x CRUD + an extra GuaranteedState:Push. Names differ (doc 'Device'/'Scope'/'InstructionExecution' vs code 'Infrastructure'/no Scope/'Execution').
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. server/core/src/rbac_store.cpp:402-417 seeds ITServiceOwner across 16 securable types (Infrastructure, InstructionDefinition, InstructionSet, Execution, Schedule, Approval, Tag, AuditLog, Response, ManagementGroup, Policy, DeviceToken, SoftwareDeployment, License, FileRetrieval, GuaranteedState), each crossed with the 5-element crud_ops array {Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Approve} (rbac_store.cpp:167,421) = 80 permissions, plus an extra GuaranteedState:Push insert (rbac_store.cpp:435) = 81 total permissions. The doc (docs/asset-tagging-guide.md:296-300) claims exactly 10 securable types and 50 permissions, and its listed names diverge from the code: doc lists Device/Scope/InstructionExecution which do NOT exist in itso_types (code uses Infrastructure, Execution, has no Scope), and the doc entirely omits Policy, DeviceToken, SoftwareDeployment, License, FileRetrieval, GuaranteedState, AuditLog, and the GuaranteedState:Push grant. Both the count and the type names are wrong; code is ahead of doc.

**Source:** CLAUDE.md line 198: "agents/plugins/   44 plugins"
**Claim:** The agent has 44 plugins under agents/plugins/.
**Evidence:** `ls -1d agents/plugins/*/` = 47 directories, all 47 wired via `subdir('agents/plugins/...')` in meson.build:347-393 (count = 47, no disk/meson mismatch). Even excluding the two demo/example plugins (example, chargen) the count is 45, still not 44.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. agents/plugins/ contains 47 plugin directories, each with its own meson.build and a shared_module/shared_library target, and all 47 are wired into the build via subdir('agents/plugins/...') in meson.build lines 347-393 (verified count = 47, no disk-vs-meson mismatch). CLAUDE.md line 198 states "44 plugins". No counting interpretation satisfies 44: full count is 47, excluding the two demo/example plugins (example, chargen) gives 45.

**Claim:** The privilege matrix covers all 217 instructions.
**Evidence:** `grep -rh 'kind: InstructionDefinition' content/definitions/*.yaml | wc -l` = 224 (234 metadata.id lines, 230 action: entries across 68 definition files). Actual shipped instruction count is 224, not 217.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed independently. docs/agent-privilege-model.md:70 heads the privilege matrix with "(all 217 instructions)". The actual shipped catalogue is 224 `kind: InstructionDefinition` documents across 68 files in content/definitions/*.yaml (`grep -rh 'kind: InstructionDefinition' content/definitions/*.yaml | wc -l` = 224; kinds breakdown also shows 10 InstructionSet + 5 TriggerTemplate + 1 Policy separately, so 224 is the clean instruction-definition figure). Even discounting the 3 demo definitions in t2_chaining_examples.yaml the count is 221 — still > 217. The "217" string appears exactly once in the whole repo and was written on 2026-05-06 (commit c951af55) and never updated as the catalogue grew. Documented 217 < actual 224 => code-ahead-of-doc, real drift.

**Source:** docs/capability-map.md:29-35
**Claim:** Progress at a Glance: New (Ph 8-16) = 2/44 done (5%), with Phase 8 having only 8.1 and 8.2 done.
**Evidence:** Roadmap line 85 shows 8.3 (Response Offloading) explicitly marked Done. offload_routes.cpp and offload_target_store.cpp exist and are wired in agent_service_impl.cpp:499-1239. Additionally, scope-walking features 15.B and 15.C are shipped in code (result_set_store.cpp 857 lines, /api/v1/result-sets routes in rest_api_v1.cpp:3135-3570, scope_engine.cpp:420-434 has from_result_set handler, result_sets_ui.cpp exists). Real count is at minimum 3/44 (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) and likely 5/44+ once 15.B and 15.C are counted. The '5%' headline materially understates delivered capability.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The capability-map "Progress at a Glance" headline (docs/capability-map.md:33) reads "New (Ph 8-16) = 2/44 done (5%)" and the claim asserts Phase 8 has only 8.1 and 8.2 done. This is contradicted by the SAME document's own detail entry: §20.7 Response Offloading (Phase 8.3, #255) is marked Done (:white_check_mark:) at docs/capability-map.md:848. That feature is genuinely shipped: offload_target_store.cpp (30k), offload_routes.cpp, route registration in server.cpp:8561-8563 (OffloadRoutes::register_routes, not dead code), and event fan-out wired in agent_service_impl.cpp:499-516 and :1221-1239. The roadmap independently marks 8.3 Done at docs/roadmap.md:85. So Phase 8 has at least 8.1+8.2+8.3 = 3 done, not 2. Additionally, scope-walking 15.B/15.C are shipped in code (result_set_store.cpp 36k, result_sets_ui.cpp, full REST CRUD at server/core/src/rest_api_v1.cpp:3135-3571, from_result_set: handler at scope_engine.cpp:420-440) yet the map still marks them "Not implemented" at docs/capability-map.md:1139 and :1143 — a corroborating doc-behind-code gap. I could find no code or reading that satisfies the "2/44 / only 8.1 and 8.2" claim. The 5% headline materially understates delivered capability and is self-contradictory with the document's own entries.

**Source:** docs/roadmap.md:157 (Phase 15 current status table)
**Claim:** Phase 15: TAR Dashboard and Scope Walking — 0 done, 8 open, 0% progress.
**Evidence:** Issues 15.B (result-set store + REST API) and 15.C (scope-engine from_result_set + dashboard) are shipped in code per result_set_store.cpp, rest_api_v1.cpp scope-walking routes, scope_engine.cpp, and result_sets_ui.cpp. Issue 15.G (operational hardening) is PARTIAL (prometheus metrics yuzu_result_sets_total etc in rest_api_v1.cpp:3122, pin/quota enforcement present). CHANGELOG lines 1194-1234 confirm the shipping. The Phase 15 table should show at minimum 2/8 done (15.B and 15.C), with 15.G as partial.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] I independently confirmed the drift. The roadmap Phase 15 status table (docs/roadmap.md:157) reads "0 done, 8 open, 0% progress" and the per-issue detail rows mark 15.B (line 1496), 15.C (line 1503) and 15.G (line 1535) all as "Open", but the code for these is fully shipped. (1) Issue 15.B — result-set store + REST: server/core/src/result_set_store.cpp is a real 857-line store (schema, lineage, TTL, pin, gc_sweep), and the complete REST surface exists in server/core/src/rest_api_v1.cpp: GET /api/v1/result-sets (3136), POST create (3162), from-inventory-query (3227), from-tar-query (3336), from-instruction-result (3377), GET /{id} (3488), /{id}/members (3501), /{id}/lineage (3532), /{id}/pin (3555), /{id}/unpin (3576), /{id}/re-eval (3428), DELETE /{id} (3596). (2) Issue 15.C — scope engine from_result_set: server/core/src/scope_engine.cpp:425 parses the from_result_set:<id-or-alias> short-circuit kind, and server/core/src/result_sets_ui.cpp renders the sidebar (render_result_sets_sidebar:46), lineage breadcrumb (line 90) and copyable from_result_set: scope token (line 116). (3) Issue 15.G — operational hardening is PARTIAL: gc_sweep wired in server/core/src/server.cpp:7881, per-owner quota/pin caps (kMaxPerOwner/kMaxPinsPerOwner in result_set_store.cpp), and Prometheus metrics yuzu_result_sets_total (rest_api_v1.cpp:3122), yuzu_result_sets_alive (server.cpp:7891), yuzu_result_set_quota_rejected (resolve_seconds histogram not found). Git history confirms shipping: commit 68427bba "feat(scope-walking): result-set store, REST, from_result_set: scope kind, dashboard UI" and 4f10a69b (PR 1202 review fixes). The table should show at minimum 2/8 done (15.B + 15.C) with 15.G partial. I could not refute the auditor.

**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/enterprise-readiness-soc2-first-customer.md §3.5 Data Inventory table
**Claim:** Server-side data inventory lists all stores as 'server-side SQLite stores': audit.db, responses.db, guaranteed-state.db, ca.db, etc.
**Evidence:** The vast majority of named SQLite stores (audit_store.cpp, response_store.cpp, guaranteed_state_store.cpp, ca_store.cpp, policy_store.cpp, etc.) still use sqlite3 directly — confirmed by audit_store.cpp:5 includes sqlite3.h. However, OfflineEndpointStore is now born-on-Postgres (offline_endpoint_store.cpp:5 includes pg/pg_pool.hpp, line 58 takes PgPool&) and the server boot requires PostgreSQL per server.cpp:937-938. The data inventory table misses the new endpoint_state schema on Postgres and will need updating as each store migrates.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed. The SOC2 data-inventory section at docs/enterprise-readiness-soc2-first-customer.md:144 is titled "Data Inventory — server-side SQLite stores" and the listed rows (audit.db, responses.db, guaranteed-state.db, ca.db) are individually accurate — those stores still use SQLite directly (audit_store.cpp:5, response_store.cpp:6, guaranteed_state_store.cpp:7, ca_store.cpp:5 all #include <sqlite3.h>; policy_store.hpp:3 / policy_store.cpp:62 use sqlite3_open_v2). However the section's framing and enumeration have drifted: (1) offline_endpoint_store.cpp:5-6,58 is born-on-Postgres — it takes a pg::PgPool& and writes the endpoint_state Postgres schema (offline_endpoint_store.cpp:20,92), the only one of 28 server stores not exclusively SQLite-backed, and the table omits it entirely; (2) the server now FAILS CLOSED without PostgreSQL (server.cpp:937-941 — "[PG] Refusing to start", "the server requires Postgres"), so the "SQLite stores" heading mis-frames the now-mandatory Postgres substrate; (3) a doc-wide grep for postgres/postgresql/endpoint_state/ADR-0006/substrate in the file returns zero hits, so the substrate migration is unacknowledged in this inventory.

### `asp-10` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Aspirational accuracy (capability-map/roadmap/parity/SOC2) (Tier B)
**Source:** docs/capability-map.md:29-35 (Progress at a Glance) and §16 Policy and Compliance Engine
**Claim:** Advanced tier: 101/101 done (100%). Domain 16 'Policy & Compliance Engine' shows 8/8 done.
**Evidence:** §18.10 Two-Factor Authentication for Approvals is explicitly tagged T2 (Advanced tier) at capability-map.md:780 and marked :x: Not implemented. The domain summary table (line 57) shows '18. Auth & Authorization | 10 | 9 | 0 | 1' — 1 Not Started at T2. If Advanced tier is defined as T2 items, 18.10 being T2 and :x: means Advanced cannot be 100%. The 101/101 count either incorrectly excludes 18.10 from the Advanced count, or the T2 tag on 18.10 is wrong.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Confirmed the drift is real — it is a self-contradiction within docs/capability-map.md. The legend at line 22 defines T2 = "Advanced". Section §18.10 "Two-Factor Authentication for Approvals" is tagged `T2` and marked `:x:` Not implemented at capability-map.md:780. The domain summary table corroborates this at line 57: "18. Auth & Authorization | 10 | 9 | 0 | 1" (1 Not Started). I independently counted the T2-tagged capability headings in the headline's scope (domains 1–24, before the separately-tracked Phase 8–16 §25+ rows): 100 total, 99 Done, exactly 1 Not Started — and that single Not-Started T2 item is §18.10 (verified via grep '^###.*`T2`' filtered to ':x:'). The "Progress at a Glance" headline at line 31 nonetheless asserts "Advanced 101/101 done (100%)". A tier containing an explicitly Not-Started member cannot be 100% done, and both the total (101 vs actual 100) and the done count (101 vs actual 99) are inconsistent with the body and the per-domain table. I also checked the code: TOTP/MFA scaffolding exists (server/core/src/totp.hpp, auth_db.cpp mfa_* operations) and a step_up_fn gates some sensitive REST routes (tokens, sessions, software-packages in rest_api_v1.cpp), but it is login/step-up MFA — not wired into the approval workflows that §18.10 specifically describes (no step_up_fn on approval routes in workflow_routes.cpp). So the doc's `:x:` on §18.10 is itself accurate; the only error is the 100% Advanced headline overstating completion. The drift is a documentation arithmetic/percentage overstatement (doc-ahead-of-code).

**Claim:** The dev docker-compose.yml server comment correctly describes the server's relationship to YUZU_POSTGRES_DSN.
**Evidence:** Comment at docker-compose.yml:33-37 says the server does not consume the DSN and 'still boots without Postgres', but server.cpp:938-991 now requires the DSN and fails closed (PR 3 landed, commit 09e0f4cd). The compose itself does provide a postgres service with depends_on service_healthy (:52-54, :58-85), so the stack actually works — only the comment is stale.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. The compose comment at deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml:33-37 claims the server 'does not consume this yet', that #1320 'wires' it (future tense), that the DSN 'is inert', that 'the server still boots without Postgres', and that 'the current binary would reject an unknown --postgres-dsn flag'. The code contradicts all of these: main.cpp:144-148 now defines the --postgres-dsn CLI option bound to YUZU_POSTGRES_DSN via ->envname() (so the flag is NOT rejected, and the help text itself says 'REQUIRED — the server fails closed without a reachable database'); server.cpp:937-941 sets startup_failed_ and logs '[PG] Refusing to start' when the DSN is empty; server.cpp:964-967 also fails closed if the DSN is unreachable. The DSN is therefore consumed and mandatory — not inert, and the server does NOT boot without Postgres. Git history confirms #1320 PR 3 has landed (HEAD 1f375f29 / e21c170d / 09e0f4cd), so the comment's anticipatory future-tense wording is now stale (doc-behind-code).

**Source:** docs/user-manual/gateway.md:148-150: 'sends them in a single BatchHeartbeat RPC at a configurable interval (default: 10 seconds)'; config example shows {heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 10000}.
**Claim:** The default heartbeat batching interval is 10 seconds (10000 ms).
**Evidence:** gateway/config/sys.config:20 sets {heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 1000} (comment: '1s gives ~0.5s avg latency'); yuzu_gw_heartbeat_buffer.erl:62 code default is also 1000ms. The shipped default is 1s, not the documented 10s.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The doc at docs/user-manual/gateway.md:150 states the default heartbeat batching interval is 10 seconds and (per the cited example) shows {heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 10000}. Every authoritative code/config default is 1000 ms (1 second): the code fallback in gateway/apps/yuzu_gw/src/yuzu_gw_heartbeat_buffer.erl:62 (application:get_env(yuzu_gw, heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 1000)), the dev config gateway/config/sys.config:20 ({heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 1000}, comment '1s gives ~0.5s avg latency'), and the prod config gateway/config/sys.config.prod:39 ({heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 1000}). No code path yields a 10-second default. The doc is off by 10x in the contradicting direction.

**Domain:** Gateway (Erlang) (Tier D)
**Source:** docs/user-manual/gateway.md:226-261 config example: {mgmt_listen_port,50052}, {upstream_pool_size,16}.
**Claim:** Default config: mgmt_listen_port=50052, upstream_pool_size=16.
**Evidence:** gateway/config/sys.config:9 mgmt_listen_port=50063 (not 50052); :17 upstream_pool_size=32 (not 16). The same doc's TLS-posture table (line 284) correctly uses 50063, so the config-example block is internally stale.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. The doc config example at docs/user-manual/gateway.md:238 specifies {mgmt_listen_port, 50052} and :245 specifies {upstream_pool_size, 16}, but the actual default config gateway/config/sys.config:9 sets {mgmt_listen_port, 50063} and :17 sets {upstream_pool_size, 32}. The production config gateway/config/sys.config.prod:29,36 also uses 50063/32. The grpcbox listener block (sys.config:79) binds port 50063, and the same doc's TLS-posture table (gateway.md:284) correctly cites :50063 — so the config-example block is internally stale/contradictory. No in-code fallback default of 50052 or 16 exists; yuzu_gw_app.erl reads these keys straight from application env, which is sourced from these config files. Both documented values are wrong.

**Source:** docs/user-manual/gateway.md:188-222: GatewayUpstream service RPC table lists exactly ProxyRegister, BatchHeartbeat, ProxyInventory, NotifyStreamStatus with the given message field numbers.
**Claim:** The GatewayUpstream RPC set and message field numbers match the proto.
**Evidence:** proto/yuzu/gateway/v1/gateway.proto field numbers match exactly (BatchHeartbeatRequest heartbeats=1/gateway_node=2 :47-52; StreamStatusNotification agent_id=1..gateway_node=5 :58-72). BUT a 5th RPC ForwardGuardianMessage (:43-44) exists in both the canonical proto and gateway_pb and is wired (yuzu_gw_upstream.erl:490, forward_guardian_message), absent from the doc's RPC table.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed independently. The doc RPC table at docs/user-manual/gateway.md:188-193 lists only 4 RPCs (ProxyRegister, BatchHeartbeat, ProxyInventory, NotifyStreamStatus). The canonical proto at proto/yuzu/gateway/v1/gateway.proto:13-45 defines a 5th RPC, ForwardGuardianMessage (lines 43-44, request/response ForwardGuardianRequest/ForwardGuardianAck). This 5th RPC is fully wired in the gateway: gateway_pb.erl:6136 (service def) and :6149 (rpc names list) register it; yuzu_gw_upstream.erl:46/116-117 exports and implements forward_guardian_message/2, :490 maps its types, and :236 issues the do_rpc('ForwardGuardianMessage',...); yuzu_gw_guardian.erl:42 invokes it; dedicated tests exist (yuzu_gw_guardian_forward_tests.erl). The message field numbers cited (BatchHeartbeatRequest heartbeats=1/gateway_node=2 at proto:47-52; StreamStatusNotification agent_id=1..gateway_node=5 at proto:58-72) do match the doc exactly, so the only gap is the missing RPC-table row — code-ahead-of-doc, partial.

**Claim:** An ADR-0002 encodes the gateway scaling decision used to verify this domain.
**Evidence:** docs/adr/0002-reachability-graph-data-model.md is about the attack-path reachability graph, NOT the gateway. No docs/adrs/ directory exists; grep for gateway-scaling/0002-scal in docs/adr* returns nothing. The gateway-scaling ADR referenced by memory is absent on branch feat/postgres-f3-flip.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift on branch feat/postgres-f3-flip. (1) docs/adr/0002-reachability-graph-data-model.md:7-26 is about the attack-path reachability graph (host/service nodes, two edge classes), not the gateway. (2) The cited path docs/adrs/0002-gateway-scaling.md is absent: `git cat-file -e HEAD:docs/adrs/0002-gateway-scaling.md` fails with 'does not exist in HEAD', and docs/adrs/ does not exist in the working tree. (3) A real gateway-scaling ADR-0002 (commit e00dd8d8, '#376 ADR-0002 — gateway scaling toward WhatsApp/RabbitMQ tier') exists, but `git branch -a --contains e00dd8d8` shows it lives ONLY on feat/quic-transport, not on this branch.

**Domain:** Instruction Engine & executions ladder (Tier C)
**Source:** executions-history-ladder.md PR2 'Known coverage gap': lists MCP execute_instruction (mcp_server.cpp) among dispatch surfaces that produce execution_id='' responses
**Claim:** MCP execute_instruction produces execution_id='' responses (does not thread execution_id)
**Evidence:** Contradicted by code: mcp_server.cpp:2306-2366 now creates the execution row and threads execution_id into dispatch_fn (#1088). The ladder doc lines 26-29 still list 'MCP execute_instruction (mcp_server.cpp)' in the coverage-gap bullet list as if unwired.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift is real. The doc (docs/executions-history-ladder.md lines 24-29, "Known coverage gap") still lists "MCP execute_instruction (mcp_server.cpp)" among dispatch surfaces that produce execution_id='' responses falling back to the legacy timestamp-window join. The code contradicts this: server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp now creates the execution row via execution_tracker->create_execution() (line 2332, comment "#1088 — create the execution row BEFORE dispatch"), threads execution_id into dispatch_fn as its 6th argument (line 2366), updates set_agents_targeted (line 2423), and includes execution_id in both the success and no_agents_reached response payloads (lines 2401, 2433). CLAUDE.md's routed-concerns entry independently corroborates: "MCP execute_instruction as a tracked-execution producer (#1088)". So MCP execute_instruction is a fully wired tracked-execution producer, no longer a coverage gap, yet the ladder doc's gap list was not updated. This is a stale-doc drift, code-ahead-of-doc.

### `instr-20` · LOW · DRIFTED · code-ahead-of-doc
**Domain:** Instruction Engine & executions ladder (Tier B)
**Source:** Instruction-Engine.md sec 3 Current-State Assessment table: InstructionStore/ExecutionTracker/ApprovalManager/ScheduleEngine marked 'Stub' (DDL + signatures only, no business logic)
**Claim:** InstructionStore, ExecutionTracker, ApprovalManager, and ScheduleEngine are stubs with no business logic
**Evidence:** All four are full implementations: instruction_store.cpp (1025 LOC, CRUD+import/export+signature verify), execution_tracker.cpp (758 LOC, create/query/upsert/refresh_counts/rerun/cancel + SSE publish), approval_manager.cpp (309 LOC, submit/approve/reject/pending_count with ownership rule), schedule_engine.cpp (358 LOC, frequency validation/evaluate_due/advance). The same doc's sec 1 ('Verified from implementation') and sec 3 footer ('Instruction engine fully implemented') already contradict the 'Stub' table.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. The doc's section 3 "Current-State Assessment" table at HEAD (docs/Instruction-Engine.md:52-55) marks InstructionStore, ExecutionTracker, ApprovalManager, and ScheduleEngine all as "Stub" with notes saying only DDL + signatures defined, "no business logic" (also stated at line 40). The actual code contradicts this: server/core/src/instruction_store.cpp (1025 LOC) has full CRUD + JSON import/export + signature verification (import_definition_json_impl, create/update/delete_definition, export_definition_json); execution_tracker.cpp (758 LOC) has create_execution INSERT, query/summary, update_agent_status with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE upsert + SSE publish (lines 320-380), get_children/rerun; approval_manager.cpp (309 LOC) implements submit/query/approve/reject/pending_count with the ownership rule "reviewer must not be the submitter" (approval_manager.cpp:274-275); schedule_engine.cpp (358 LOC) has is_valid_frequency, compute_initial_next_execution, evaluate_due() (line 272), advance_schedule() (line 302), full CRUD. The code was committed Apr-Jun 2026 (predating the audit). The doc is even self-contradictory — line 11 ("Verified from implementation") and line 62 ("Instruction engine fully implemented") refute its own "Stub" table. The "Stub" status labels are stale; this is code-ahead-of-doc drift.

**Source:** Instruction-Engine.md lines 62 & 1453: '150/184 capabilities done (82%). All 7 phases complete (72/72 issues). Instruction engine fully implemented.'
**Claim:** Overall progress is 150/184 capabilities (82%)
**Evidence:** docs/capability-map.md:30-35 reports a different ledger: Foundation 33/33, Advanced 101/101, Future 33/50, New(Ph8-16) 2/44, Overall 169/228 done (74%). The 150/184 (82%) figure in Instruction-Engine.md does not match the authoritative capability-map, and CLAUDE.md itself warns the headline figure is overstated.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. docs/Instruction-Engine.md:62 states 'Overall progress: 150/184 capabilities done (82%). All 7 phases complete (72/72 issues)' and line 1453 cites 'docs/capability-map.md | 184 capabilities, 150 done (82%)' as its authoritative source. But the cited source no longer says that: docs/capability-map.md:35 reports 'Overall 169/228 done (74%)' and the TOTAL row at docs/capability-map.md:71 confirms 228 total / 169 done / 5 partial / 54 not-started. Git history proves capability-map.md once contained 'Overall ... 150/184 done (82%)' (recovered via `git log -S "150/184" -- docs/capability-map.md`) but was later corrected (commit db8b8d6c 'sync headline counters with table totals' plus the Phase 8-16 capability additions to 228). The 184/150 figure was never re-synced in Instruction-Engine.md, so it is stale and self-contradicts its own named source. CLAUDE.md:85 independently warns the capability-map headline is overstated, reinforcing that progress figures here are not load-bearing contracts. I could not find any current artifact that satisfies the 184/82% claim.

**Domain:** MCP & agentic-first (A1-A4) (Tier C)
**Source:** docs/mcp-server.md Phase 1 (Implemented): "26 read-only tools" + "1 write/execute tool" (27 total)
**Claim:** Phase 1 ships 26 read-only tools plus 1 write/execute tool (execute_instruction).
**Evidence:** kTools array registers 35 tools (kToolCount = sizeof; unique-name count = 35 via grep over mcp_server.cpp:189-393). The doc's enumerated Phase-1 list stops at the 26 DEX-read set and execute_instruction; code additionally has list_issued_certs, revoke_certificate, get_dex_perf_fleet/cohorts/cohort_diff, list_dex_perf_devices, get_network_fleet, list_network_devices, get_guardian_schemas.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. docs/mcp-server.md:23-34 "Phase 1 (Implemented)" claims exactly 27 implemented tools: line 25 enumerates 26 read-only tools by name (verified: 26 backtick-quoted names) and line 27 names 1 write/execute tool (execute_instruction); Phase 2 (line 34) lists only the 5 still-planned write tools (set_tag, delete_tag, approve_request, reject_request, quarantine_device). The code's kTools array (server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:189-393) registers 35 tools — kToolCount = sizeof(kTools)/sizeof at line 395 = 35, and my per-name enumeration yields 35 unique names. The 8 tools present in code but absent from the doc entirely are: get_dex_perf_fleet (291), get_dex_perf_cohorts (299), get_dex_perf_cohort_diff (306), list_dex_perf_devices (320), get_network_fleet (334), list_network_devices (346), list_issued_certs (377), revoke_certificate (385). All are security-mapped and dispatchable (mcp_server.cpp:446-451), exposed via the tools/list loop (lines 596-600), and none appear anywhere in docs/mcp-server.md. The doc undercounts implemented tools by 8 (~30%).

**Claim:** MCP tools/list enumerates 23 MCP tools.
**Evidence:** tools/list iterates kToolCount = 35 (mcp_server.cpp:596-601, kTools 35 entries). A2's "23 MCP tools" is stale.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed independently. docs/agentic-first-principle.md:35 states "MCP tools/list enumerates 23 MCP tools". The actual handler at server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:594-605 iterates `for (int i = 0; i < kToolCount; ++i)` over kTools with no filtering. kToolCount = sizeof(kTools)/sizeof(kTools[0]) (mcp_server.cpp:395), and the kTools array (mcp_server.cpp:189-393) contains exactly 35 entries — verified by both an automated name count and by listing every name (list_agents ... revoke_certificate, including the DEX, network-quality, and internal-CA tool families). The documented 23 is stale by 12 tools. I attempted to find code satisfying the 23-tool claim (e.g. a read-only-mode subset that hides write tools from tools/list) but none exists — tools/list is unconditional; read-only gating happens only at tools/call.

**Source:** docs/user-manual/mcp.md Available Tools table (34 rows) + caveat "the authoritative tool/resource/prompt list is the server's own tools/list ... counts in this document are illustrative"
**Claim:** The user-manual tool table mirrors the server's tools/list; the manual explicitly defers to the live tools/list as authoritative.
**Evidence:** Manual table has 34 numbered rows (mcp.md rows 1-34); code registers 35 tools. The manual is missing get_guardian_schemas (registered at mcp_server.cpp:260). The manual carries the explicit "counts are illustrative / tools/list authoritative" caveat (mcp.md:46-48), so it is honest about drift.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The kTools array in server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp registers 35 tools (counted from the struct entries between lines 189-393; sizeof guard at line 395). The user-manual table in docs/user-manual/mcp.md has only 34 numbered rows (lines 251-284). A set diff shows exactly one tool present in code but absent from the manual table: get_guardian_schemas, registered at mcp_server.cpp:260. No tool appears in the doc that is missing from code, so this is purely code-ahead-of-doc by one entry. The documented claim is two-part: (1) the table "mirrors" tools/list and (2) the manual "explicitly defers to the live tools/list as authoritative." Part (2) is fully satisfied — the authoritative-tools/list caveat exists verbatim at mcp.md:46-48 ("counts in this document are illustrative") and is reaffirmed at mcp.md:244. Part (1) is violated by exactly one missing row. Because the manual is explicit and honest that the static table is illustrative and tools/list is the source of truth, the impact is confined to a human reading the static table; an agentic worker following the doc's own guidance (use live tools/list) is unaffected.

**Source:** docs/mcp-server.md Phase 1: "3 resources: yuzu://server/health, yuzu://compliance/fleet, yuzu://audit/recent"
**Claim:** MCP exposes exactly 3 resources.
**Evidence:** kResources has 4 entries (mcp_server.cpp:474-481): the three named plus yuzu://guardian/schemas. resources/read handles the 4th at mcp_server.cpp:757-772.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed independently. docs/mcp-server.md:28 states "3 resources: yuzu://server/health, yuzu://compliance/fleet, yuzu://audit/recent". But kResources in server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp:474-481 defines 4 entries: the three named PLUS yuzu://guardian/schemas (line 479-480). kResourceCount = sizeof(kResources)/sizeof(kResources[0]) (line 483) therefore equals 4, and resources/list enumerates all 4 (lines 612-615). resources/read also handles the 4th URI at mcp_server.cpp:757. Notably the doc DOES list the corresponding tool get_guardian_schemas (docs/mcp-server.md:25) but omits the guardian schemas resource at line 28, so this is an internal doc inconsistency too. Could not find any code that satisfies the "exactly 3" claim — the array unambiguously has 4. Direction is code-ahead-of-doc, as the auditor stated. Severity LOW: a one-off doc undercount of a read-only resource list; no functional, contract, or security impact, just a discoverability/accuracy gap.

**Claim:** CLAUDE.md PKI routed concern describes the ladder only through PR5d; the subordinate-CA (PR6) surface (root-csr export, import-chain validation, dashboard import panel, issuer_key_id) is fully built and wired.
**Evidence:** CLAUDE.md PKI concern: grep PR6/subordinate/root-csr/import-chain = 0 hits; yet server.cpp:3131 export_ca_csr, :3175 import_subordinate_chain, ca_routes.cpp:474/:506 routes, :142 dashboard import form, ca_store.cpp:235 issuer_key_id (migration v5) all present. pki-architecture.md DOES cover PR6 (marked "in review").
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift independently confirmed. The CLAUDE.md PKI routed concern (CLAUDE.md:238) narrates the PKI PR ladder inline (PR2, PR3, PR4, PR4b, PR5, PR5b, PR5c, PR5d) and stops at PR5d — grep against that concern for PR6/subordinate/root-csr/import-chain/issuer_key_id returns 0 hits. Yet the PR6 subordinate-CA surface is fully built and wired: server.cpp:3131 export_ca_csr() and :3174 import_subordinate_chain() are real implementations wired into route registration at server.cpp:8581/:8584; ca_routes.cpp:474 GET /api/v1/ca/root-csr and :506 POST /api/v1/ca/import-chain are registered, :142 has the dashboard hx-post import <form>, :707 the dashboard /api/settings/ca/import-chain wrapper; ca_store.cpp:235 adds issuer_key_id via migration v5 plus :101-104 CaMode::Subordinate serialization and migration v4 chain_pem; and the validation engine in x509_ca.cpp (cert_matches_key:948, cert_is_ca:970, verify_chain_to_bundle:983, issuer_key_id:779) holds real OpenSSL implementations, not stubs. The routed doc docs/pki-architecture.md DOES document PR6 fully (section at :308, surfaces at :372, roadmap row at :445 marked 'in review'). So this is code-ahead-of-CLAUDE.md, with the deeper routed doc accurate — exactly the auditor's PARTIAL characterization.

**Source:** ADR-0010 Consequences + docs/user-manual/server-admin.md "Key management": KEK lifecycle audit verbs (kek.generated/rotated/retired), secret_decrypt_failures metric, --accept-voided-secrets break-glass flag
**Claim:** KEK lifecycle audit events + the yuzu_server_secret_decrypt_failures metric are wired into the running server, and a break-glass voided-secrets boot flag exists.
**Evidence:** secret_codec.hpp:254-274 defines AuditHook (unset=no-op) + decrypt_failure_counts seam, but server.cpp wires neither (grep kek.generated/secret.decrypt_failure/yuzu_server_secret_decrypt_failures = 0 hits); absent: --accept-voided-secrets across server/. server-admin.md:902/:906 honestly says rotation surface + voided-secrets flag "ship with the first secret-bearing store migration".
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. The codec MECHANISM exists and is tested — secret_codec.cpp emits kek.generated (:672), kek.rotated (:829), kek.retired (:1046), secret.decrypt_failure (:325) via emit_audit, and decrypt_failure_counts() (secret_codec.hpp:273-274) backs yuzu_server_secret_decrypt_failures_total. BUT it is NOT wired into the running server: SecretCodec is constructed only at secret_codec.cpp:264 invoked solely by tests/unit/server/test_secret_codec.cpp; grep across server/core/src/ shows no SecretCodec construction in server.cpp or any production path (only comments in aes_gcm.hpp and offline_endpoint_store.hpp, the latter stating "No secrets — plain columns, no SecretCodec"). The header itself states the wiring is pending: secret_codec.hpp:256-257 ("Wiring to the AuditStore happens where the codec is constructed (the per-store migration PRs); unset = no-op") and :270-272 (register the metric "when the wiring PR exposes it"; "the metrics endpoint reads this when the codec is wired into ServerImpl"). The --accept-voided-secrets flag exists nowhere in server/ or agents/ C++ source — only in docs/adr/0010 (:283, which itself says "named at implementation, e.g. --accept-voided-secrets") and server-admin.md:906. The user-manual is honest about deferral (server-admin.md:902 #1341, :904 "once the codec is wired into a serving store", :906 "ships with the first secret-bearing store migration"); however ADR-0010 Consequences (:210-214) presents the audit verbs/metric as active "audit-taxonomy entries from the first implementation PR" without the same not-yet-wired caveat — the doc-ahead-of-code surface the claim targets.

### `policy-24` · LOW · PARTIAL · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Policy / compliance evaluation (Tier D)
**Source:** user-manual policy-engine.md:247: invalidation resets statuses to 'pending'
**Claim:** Invalidation resets all agent statuses to 'pending'.
**Evidence:** update_agent_status only accepts compliant/non_compliant/unknown/fixing/error and rejects any other status (policy_store.cpp:1016-1018); 'pending' is not a valid status. The status table (policy-engine.md:171-179) itself never lists 'pending' — it lists 'unknown' as 'Not yet evaluated, status invalidated'. The 'pending' wording in the Cache Invalidation prose is inconsistent with the rest of the doc and the enum.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift confirmed. policy-engine.md:247 (and :249 by reference) states per-policy/fleet invalidation "Reset all agent statuses to `pending`". The actual code does NOT use 'pending': PolicyStore::invalidate_policy runs `UPDATE policy_status SET status = 'unknown' WHERE policy_id = ?` (server/core/src/policy_store.cpp:1260) and invalidate_all_policies runs `UPDATE policy_status SET status = 'unknown'` (policy_store.cpp:1288). 'pending' is not a member of the valid status enum either — update_agent_status only accepts compliant/non_compliant/unknown/fixing/error and rejects anything else (policy_store.cpp:1016-1018). The doc is internally inconsistent too: its own status table (policy-engine.md:177) lists `unknown` = 'Not yet evaluated, status invalidated', which matches the code; only the Cache Invalidation prose says 'pending'. So the documented claim is not satisfied by code.

PR-D: tar_page_ui.cpp:300-478 has the scope chip (tar-sql-scope), POST /api/v1/result-sets/from-tar-query, and pollSet materialization polling — and commit e7b47ca3 is literally "feat(scope-walking): ... TAR SQL frame (PR-D)". The doc is also self-inconsistent: scope-walking-design.md §11 line 336 already marks PR-E as "Shipped", which sequentially depends on PR-B/C/D, yet tar-dashboard.md §9 still says those three are Pending. Direction is code-ahead-of-doc.

**Domain:** Fleet visualization (Tier D)
**Source:** fleet-viz-invariants.md §Process-layer PR7 — Soft cap 1000 process dots per cube; bundle size cap <80 KB
**Claim:** The renderer bundle stays under the 80 KB soft cap stated in the PR 7 process-layer invariant
**Evidence:** yuzu-viz.js is 87898 bytes (~85.8 KB), above the PR-7 '<80 KB' cap; later PRs (8/9/12) added listener/talking sockets + tube wires. The renderer doc header itself notes it 'crossed the MSVC 16,380-byte raw-string literal limit at PR 6'. No active test pins an 80 KB ceiling.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. docs/fleet-viz-invariants.md:179 states "Soft cap. 1000 process dots per cube; bundle size cap <80 KB." The actual renderer bundle server/core/static/yuzu-viz.js is 87898 bytes (~85.8 KB), which exceeds the 81920-byte (80 KB) threshold by ~5978 bytes (~7%). At PR 7 (commit 98576dbf) the same file was only 48530 bytes (well under cap), and later PRs 8/9/12 (commits cb80a285 localhost edges, ba7e34a8 listener/talking sockets, d597803a three-tier layout + tube wires) grew it past 80 KB. Git history (-S "bundle size cap") shows the cap line was added at PR 7 and never revised. There is no active enforcement: no test pins the ceiling, and server/core/scripts/embed_js.py only guards the unrelated MSVC 14,000-byte raw-string chunk limit (CHUNK_SIZE = 14_000), not a total-bundle cap. This is genuine code-ahead-of-doc drift.

### `vuln-02` · LOW · PARTIAL · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0002 (accepted): two node tiers (host + service nodes), two edge classes (network reachability + local-IPC), no identity/account nodes.
**Claim:** Code models host nodes, service nodes (host,port,proto,process), network edges, and local-IPC edges per the data model.
**Evidence:** fleet_topology_types.hpp models machines/processes/connections for the viz renderer; the design doc itself (vuln-scan-engine-design.md:43-45 considered-and-rejected) explicitly says the renderer's MachineNode/ProcessNode are a 60s-TTL rendering projection and the analytic host/service/local-IPC vocabulary is 'new vocabulary computed on a schedule' — not yet built. No service-node or local-IPC edge type exists in code (grep). The ADR data model is accepted intent, not implemented.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] I independently confirmed the drift; I could not find code satisfying the claim. The claim asserts the code "models host nodes, service nodes (host,port,proto,process), network edges, and local-IPC edges per the data model." The only topology code is server/core/src/fleet_topology_types.hpp, which models MachineNode, ProcessNode, ConnectionEdge (EdgeScope Local/InternalFleet/External), and ListenerSocket — a 60s-TTL viz renderer projection (fleet_topology_store.hpp:13,99-111 "60-second TTL ... render"). There is NO ServiceNode type keyed on (host, listening port, protocol, owning process), no analytic host node, and no network-reachability-edge (src host→dst service) or local-IPC-edge (service→service) type. A codebase-wide grep (server/, agents/, sdk/, proto/, and the .claude worktrees, excluding build dirs) for ServiceNode/service_node/host_node/local_ipc/ipc_edge/reachability_edge/trust_zone/attack_path/chokepoint found zero implementations (the only "crown jewel"/"chokepoint" hits are the unrelated CA private-key seam and generic code comments). The vuln_scan plugin (agents/plugins/vuln_scan/src/) contains no graph model. ADR-0002 itself (docs/adr/0002-reachability-graph-data-model.md:42-45, "Considered and rejected") explicitly says reusing the renderer's MachineNode/ProcessNode was rejected and that the derived analytic layer "is new vocabulary computed on a schedule" — i.e., not yet built; the parent design doc (vuln-scan-engine-design.md §3, "North Star — for review", graph layer = Phases 6-8) confirms the model is future work. The auditor's PARTIAL / doc-ahead-of-code verdict is accurate.

### `vuln-03` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0003 (accepted): move connection capture from poll to event-driven (eBPF/ETW/NetworkExtension), edge-aggregated, federated agent SQLite edge warehouse; raw firehose never reaches server.
**Claim:** Flow telemetry is event-driven and edge-aggregated into a federated agent SQLite warehouse.
**Evidence:** Capture is still poll-based: design doc 4.1 table marks per-connection capture 'Have (observed); poll-based — misses short-lived flows' and 4.2 'Move to event capture' as Add. No eBPF/ETW-flow/NetworkExtension flow collector exists for the reachability graph (grep for the event-capture flow path returns DEX/TAR collectors, not a flow-summary edge warehouse). ADR is accepted; code unchanged from the poll PoC.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed: no event-driven flow capture exists for the reachability/vuln-scan graph; capture is still poll-based, matching the PoC the ADR set out to replace. Evidence in code: agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_network_collector.cpp uses GetExtendedTcpTable (lines 713/719/747/753), /proc/net/tcp + /proc/net/tcp6 (lines 356-357), and libproc (line 54), and explicitly returns empty for Windows quality with a note that Microsoft-Windows-TCPIP ETW is kPlanned (lines 858-860). The only ETW present is PROCESS capture (agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_proc_etw.hpp — Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process, not network flow). No eBPF/tracepoint flow collector (the only tcp_connect hits are the SQL helper TarDatabase::query_recent_tcp_connections, tar_db.cpp:661) and no NetworkExtension/.mm files exist. The graph is fed by fleet_snapshot.v1 built from the live /proc/net/tcp snapshot merged with the TAR warehouse (agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_fleet_snapshot.hpp:81-90) — a poll, not an event firehose, and no (src,dst,port,proto,first_seen,last_seen,count) flow-summary edge warehouse. ADR-0003 (docs/adr/0003-telemetry-capture-model.md, status: accepted) states the flow telemetry IS event-driven, edge-aggregated, and federated; the design doc's own §4.1/§4.2 honestly mark 'Event-driven flow capture' as Add. So the ADR is doc-ahead-of-code drift, as the auditor found.

### `vuln-04` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0004 (accepted, generalised by ADR-0006): the derived scored graph + cross-store scoring join + pgvector live in server-side PostgreSQL; agent SQLite stays the federated edge warehouse.
**Claim:** The derived scored reachability graph is persisted in server-side PostgreSQL (with pgvector for identity matching).
**Evidence:** No persisted reachability/scored-graph store exists in Postgres or anywhere: grep for reachability/graph/edge/attack_path store returns NONE. The observed graph (FleetTopologyStore) is in-memory only (60s TTL, no history — fleet_topology_store.hpp:13-26). The one existing vuln store, NvdDatabase, is SQLite (nvd_db.hpp:3,64; nvd_db.cpp:213 sqlite3_open_v2, :256 CREATE TABLE cve) and pre-dates the ADR. No pgvector usage anywhere.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] I independently confirm the drift is real. The documented claim — a derived, scored reachability graph persisted in server-side PostgreSQL with pgvector for identity matching — is NOT implemented in code. Evidence I verified myself: (1) The server pg/ store directory (server/core/src/pg/) contains only the substrate (pg_raii.hpp, pg_pool.cpp, pg_migration_runner.cpp, secret_codec) and NO graph/scored-graph/reachability store. (2) The only Postgres-backed store in the entire server is offline_endpoint_store (offline_endpoint_store.hpp:46,69 take a PgPool&) — that is the "last-known endpoint state" half of ADR-0004, not the scored graph. (3) fleet_topology_store.cpp has NO persistence at all (grep for sqlite3_open/PgPool/INSERT INTO/CREATE TABLE returns nothing); the header confirms it is a pure in-memory aggregator with a 60s-TTL cache holding all state in std::unordered_map members (fleet_topology_store.hpp:323-369). (4) The one existing vuln store, NvdDatabase, is SQLite (raw sqlite3* at nvd_db.hpp:3,64) and is a CVE-feed cache, not a scored reachability graph. (5) No pgvector usage in any source file — it appears only in deploy/CI files where the Postgres Docker image is built WITH the extension available (docker-compose.reference.yml, release.yml), but nothing in the application code uses it. (6) No scoring/attack-path/chokepoint/adjacency logic exists for the vuln graph. The design doc itself confirms this is doc-ahead-of-code: docs/vuln-scan-engine-design.md marks "Persisted reachability graph + history" as "Add" (line 277), lists pgvector identity matching as Phase 4 and "Topology ingest & persistence" as Phase 6 (lines 452,459-460), and notes only Phase 0 (Spike #1206) is DONE (line 440). docs/plans/threat-graph-roadmap.md is labeled "Internal planning draft." The claim under review is decided-but-unbuilt target architecture.", "refuted": false

### `vuln-05` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0005 (accepted): attack-path scoring via depth-bounded max-probability paths (Dijkstra + Yen k-shortest), per-finding attack-path score replaces raw CVSS as default ranking.
**Claim:** Findings are ranked by a depth-bounded max-probability attack-path score (Dijkstra/Yen), replacing raw CVSS.
**Evidence:** No attack-path scoring code exists: grep -E 'dijkstra|yen.*shortest|attack.path.scor|traversab' across agents/ server/ proto/ (excluding tests/worktrees) returns NONE. Findings, where produced at all (NvdDatabase::match_inventory, nvd_db.cpp:358), carry only a bare severity label (CveMatch has no score/path field, nvd_db.hpp:31-39). ADR algorithm decisions are 'accepted, substrate-independent' (ADR-0005:52-59) but explicitly unbuilt (design doc Phase 7).
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed: no attack-path scoring code exists. Grep for dijkstra|yen|k-shortest|attack_path|traversab|max_prob across agents/server/proto/sdk (excluding tests/build dirs) returns nothing relevant; the only chokepoint/crown-jewel hits are unrelated (server/core/src/key_provider.hpp:6, guardian_ingest.hpp:37, device_routes.cpp:344 — CA key + audit chokepoints, not graph scoring). The finding struct CveMatch (server/core/src/nvd_db.hpp:31-39) has no score/path field — only a bare severity label. The producer NvdDatabase::match_inventory (server/core/src/nvd_db.cpp:357) just runs a LIKE SELECT + version compare with no ranking; the vuln_scan plugin has zero scoring logic (its only std::sort at agents/plugins/vuln_scan/src/vuln_scan_plugin.cpp:199 sorts AppInfo). The capability is genuinely unbuilt. CAVEAT lowering severity: the source docs are self-honest, not overclaiming. ADR-0005 (docs/adr/0005-attack-path-and-chokepoint-scoring.md:52-59) marks only the *algorithm* decisions 'accepted' and explicitly ties the scoring join to a not-yet-relied-on substrate; the design doc lists it as 'Phase 7' (docs/vuln-scan-engine-design.md:464-468) and states 'until Phase 7, no attack-path claims' (line 486-487). So the gap is roadmap/ADR-vs-implementation on an explicitly-accepted-but-unbuilt feature whose docs already flag the unbuilt status, rather than a doc falsely asserting a shipped present-tense capability.

### `vuln-06` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0005: chokepoints via path-set frequency over top-k paths; segmentation via cost-weighted min-cut; multi-jewel via MST/Kruskal (Phase 8).
**Claim:** Chokepoint (path-set frequency) and segmentation (cost-weighted min-cut) recommendations are computed.
**Evidence:** grep -E 'chokepoint|min.cut|mincut|steiner|kruskal' across agents/ server/ proto/ (excluding tests/worktrees) returns NONE. The only 'chokepoint'/'crown jewel' string hits are PKI CA-key comments (ca_store.hpp:9, key_provider.hpp:6, server.cpp:219,2915) — unrelated. Phase 8, unbuilt.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift. ADR-0005 (docs/adr/0005-attack-path-and-chokepoint-scoring.md:26-31) documents chokepoints via path-set frequency over top-k paths, segmentation via cost-weighted min-cut, and multi-jewel via MST/Kruskal "(later, Phase 8)". No implementation exists anywhere in agents/, server/, proto/, sdk/: zero hits for min-cut/mincut/steiner/kruskal; every 'chokepoint' string is an unrelated code-flow single-entry-point pattern; every 'crown jewel' string is a PKI CA-key comment (ca_store.hpp, key_provider.hpp, server.cpp:219/2915). None of the specified algorithms (Dijkstra/Yen k-shortest/Bellman-Ford/label-propagation/Pregel) or scoring inputs (EPSS/KEV/w=-log P) appear in code — apparent grep hits were false positives (MfaAlreadyEnrolled matching 'yen'; 'traverse' in network comments). The only adjacent code is fleet_topology_store (ADR-0002 observed graph, no scoring) and the vuln_scan plugin (per-host CVE/config matcher, no graph reasoning). The 'Phase 8' references in code are an unrelated feature-phase numbering (#254 response templates, #255 offload), not ADR-0005's Phase 8.

### `vuln-07` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier A)
**Source:** ADR-0005 two-matcher split: an agent-side KEV-only pre-filter self-flags candidates; the server-side authoritative matcher is the only source of low-FP findings; the ~200x KEV/NVD size ratio is the line.
**Claim:** An agent-side KEV-only pre-filter (zero-message local flags) exists, separate from the server authoritative matcher.
**Evidence:** No KEV pre-filter or KEV flag exists anywhere: grep -E 'kev|known.exploited|cisa.kev' across vuln_scan plugin and nvd_*.cpp/hpp returns NONE. The agent vuln_scan plugin still ships the full static matcher (cve_rules.hpp CveRule with affected_below, icontains/compare_versions — agents/plugins/vuln_scan/src/cve_rules.hpp:8-21), not a KEV-only pre-filter. ADR accepted, unbuilt.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Drift is real and independently confirmed. (1) No KEV pre-filter or flag exists anywhere: my own grep of 'kev|known.exploited|cisa.kev' across agents/ and server/ C++ returns only unrelated tokens (kevent, NetworkEvent, kEval). (2) The agent plugin ships a static matcher, not a KEV pre-filter — agents/plugins/vuln_scan/src/vuln_scan_plugin.cpp:334-358 (do_cve_scan_impl) loops yuzu::vuln::kCveRules (defined cve_rules.hpp:72) using icontains product match + compare_versions(app.version, rule.affected_below); CveRule (cve_rules.hpp:8-15) has no KEV/known-exploited field and there is no (has-KEV ∧ exposes-service) self-flag. (3) The doc describes the feature as architecture: docs/adr/0005-attack-path-and-chokepoint-scoring.md:38-42 (status 'accepted', line 2) defines the 'agent-side KEV-only pre-filter' with the ~200x ratio; docs/vuln-scan-engine-design.md:315-326 tabulates the two-matcher split. (4) The design doc itself confirms it is unbuilt future work — line 449 'Phase 3 ... ship the `kev` flag ... (enables §4.4)' and line 445 marks current state as Phase 0 spike with the matcher 'acknowledged PoC-grade'. So the documented KEV pre-filter is accepted-but-not-implemented: doc-ahead-of-code drift, exactly as the auditor found.

### `vuln-14` · LOW · PARTIAL · code-ahead-of-doc
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier B)
**Source:** capability-map.md §9.4: 'Vulnerability Scanning :white_check_mark: T1 — vuln_scan plugin + NVD database sync on server.'
**Claim:** Vulnerability scanning is a completed (checkmark) capability.
**Evidence:** The checkmark is defensible for the narrow claim it makes (plugin + server NVD sync both exist: vuln_scan_plugin.cpp, nvd_sync.cpp wired server.cpp:907). But it omits the design doc's own honesty bar (§8: 'until Phase 2 lands, capability-map describes this as an early heuristic matcher, NOT modern vulnerability scanning'). The capability-map text does not carry that caveat, so the checkmark overstates maturity given the substring/single-bound/no-backport matcher (vuln-12).
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Independently confirmed the drift; could not refute it. The literal §9.4 claim ("vuln_scan plugin + NVD database sync on server") is TRUE: the plugin exists (agents/plugins/vuln_scan/src/vuln_scan_plugin.cpp), NvdSyncManager is constructed and started at server.cpp:910-912, status/sync endpoints at server.cpp:5151+, and the matcher match_inventory is wired (nvd_db.cpp:358, REST /api/nvd/match at server.cpp:5221, fleet_topology_store.cpp:824). HOWEVER the drift is real on maturity: (1) The matcher is PoC-grade exactly as critiqued — nvd_db.cpp:365/379 matches product via LIKE '%name%' (substring), uses a SINGLE upper bound 'affected_below' with no versionStartIncluding lower bound (lines 385-391), and has NO backport/distro-advisory correlation (only product/affected_below/fixed_in/severity columns). (2) The design doc explicitly mandates the missing caveat: vuln-scan-engine-design.md:485-487 says "until Phase 2 lands, capability-map.md describes this as an early heuristic matcher, NOT 'modern vulnerability scanning'"; the doc header marks itself "Supersedes the static PoC matcher" and Phase 0 notes "matcher acknowledged PoC-grade". (3) grep of capability-map.md confirms NO maturity caveat anywhere near §9.4 (no heuristic/PoC/spike/Phase-2 text). So the ✅ T1 checkmark overstates maturity by omitting the project's own required honesty note; direction is doc-overstates / code-ahead-of-doc.

### `vuln-15` · LOW · DRIFTED · doc-ahead-of-code
**Domain:** Vuln / reachability engine (Tier D)
**Source:** design doc §6: scope-walking materializes graph-produced host sets (hosts on a probable attack path / chokepoint hosts) as result sets (from_result_set:<id>) for remediation.
**Claim:** Graph conclusions (attack-path host sets, chokepoint hosts) become actionable result sets via scope-walking.
**Evidence:** Scope-walking / result-sets exists as a separate primitive, but there is no graph layer producing attack-path or chokepoint host sets to feed it (vuln-05, vuln-06 NONE). The integration the doc describes cannot exist because its upstream (the scored graph) is unbuilt. Phase 7/8 dependent.
**Verdict note:** [drift upheld] Confirmed the drift independently. The scope-walking / result-set primitive fully exists (server/core/src/result_set_store.{hpp,cpp}, scope_engine.cpp:425 implements the `from_result_set:` short-circuit, result_set_matcher.cpp, result_sets_ui.cpp). But the result-set source kinds are exactly four (result_set_store.hpp:43-46: inventory_query, tar_query, instruction_result, manual_curate) — there is no attack_path or chokepoint source kind. More fundamentally, the upstream graph layer that §6 says "produces host sets (hosts on a probable attack path to a jewel; the chokepoint hosts)" does NOT exist: grep across server/ and agents/ finds zero reachability-graph code, no Dijkstra/Yen/min-cut/betweenness, and no crown_jewel/trust_zone/entry_point/traversability code (the only "graph" hit is the generic cytoscape.min.js; every "chokepoint" hit is an unrelated security/ingest chokepoint). The vuln_scan plugin is the PoC matcher only (scan/cve_scan/config_scan/summary/inventory) and is explicitly marked superseded by this design. The integration §6 describes therefore cannot exist because its upstream (the scored graph) is unbuilt — exactly what the auditor concluded. The doc itself confirms this is aspirational: it is labeled "North Star — for review" with the graph layer scoped to Phases 7 (attack-path scoring) and 8 (chokepoints), and the capability map states "until Phase 7, no attack-path claims."

**Domain:** Gateway (Erlang) (Tier C)
**Source:** docs/erlang-gateway-build.md:11: 'rebar3 eunit --dir apps/yuzu_gw/test  # unit tests (148 tests)'.
**Claim:** The standard gateway eunit suite contains 148 tests.
**Evidence:** Static count: 98 simple foo_test()/-> functions + 17 foo_test_() generators across apps/yuzu_gw/test/*.erl. Generators expand via foreach/setup fixtures into an unknown multiple, so 148 is plausible but cannot be confirmed without running. Erlang toolchain is not activatable in this sandbox (ensure-erlang.sh found no kerl/asdf/brew install; command -v erl fails).

- `tar-21` [A] The full result-sets REST surface (list/get/create/from-*/lineage/members/pin/unpin/re-eval/delete) is wired. — _server/core/src/rest_api_v1_
- `tar-22` [D] The tag-categories and tag-compliance REST endpoints exist with the documented behaviour. — _settings_routes_
- `tar-23` [A] Membership is materialised at create time and resolution silently drops stale members rather than erroring. — _result_set_store_

<details><summary><b>Vuln / reachability engine</b> — 8 confirmed</summary>

- `vuln-01` [A] The reachability graph is built from observed flows only (no potential/config-derived edges, no fabric reachability). — _The only graph-bearing code is FleetTopologyStore (server/core/src/fleet_topology_store_
- `vuln-08` [A] A graph/topology securable type and audited trust-zone/crown-jewel authoring surfaces exist. — _Doc itself states 'neither exists today' (§3_
- `vuln-09` [C] FleetTopologyStore exists today as an in-memory observed host-to-host graph with IP→agent resolution and edge classification. — _server/core/src/fleet_topology_store_
- `vuln-10` [C] The NVD vuln overlay on the topology graph is wired but inert (produces no findings today). — _fleet_topology_store_
- `vuln-11` [C] Phase 0 spike is done: agent inventory action, runtime rule delivery, static matcher present; that PoC matcher is the thing later phases supersede. — _agents/plugins/vuln_scan/ present: vuln_scan_plugin_
- `vuln-12` [C] The server-side matcher is the engine (CPE/PURL identity, version ranges, backport correctness) — i.e. Phases 1-2 done. — _Server matcher is STILL the PoC: NvdDatabase::match_inventory uses 'product LIKE %name_lower%' + single compare_versions(version, affected_b_
- `vuln-13` [C] A server-side NVD mirror with background sync (real NVD API fetch) exists and is wired into the server. — _NvdDatabase (SQLite cve table, nvd_db_
- `vuln-16` [A] Container/instance attribution in the graph is platform-gated and never claims cross-kernel visibility. — _No container-attribution code in the reachability graph path exists yet (the eBPF cgroup / Windows-silo attribution is Phase 6 'Add' per des_
