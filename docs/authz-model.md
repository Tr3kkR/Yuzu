# The authz MODEL (ADR-0033 §2) and per-device dispatch visibility (#1788)

This document covers two related but separable pieces of PR1.4:

1. **The registry-independent authz MODEL** (`server/core/src/authz_model.hpp`) — the
   securable×operation×risk_tier×mcp_tier_class classification a future runtime
   capability-declaration registry (PR1.9) will consume when a Module registers a tool or REST
   route.
2. **The #1788 fix** — closing the `/api/command` per-device visibility gap across all four
   dispatch arms.

Both live in `authz_model.hpp` because the second reuses the first's shared `VisibleSet`
primitive, but they are independent: the model does not enforce anything, and the #1788 fix does
not depend on the seed catalogue.

## Spine-version assumption

This PR is written against **ADR-0033 as accepted 2026-07-14** (`docs/adr/0033-access-control-spine.md`,
"design-only, binds prospectively"). Alex accepted the rework risk of building against that spine
before the runtime capability-declaration registry (ADR-0033 §2's own stated precondition) exists —
if the ADR is amended before PR1.9 lands, this schema may need a rework pass.

## 1. The authz MODEL

### Vocabulary

- **`securable`** — reuses an existing `RbacStore::list_securable_types()` entry (22 seeded types,
  `rbac_store.cpp:291-327`, read-only reference for this PR) wherever one accurately describes the
  protected resource. A Module minting a genuinely new securable is an ADR-0033 §2 escape hatch that
  is **not built yet** — its own stated precondition is the runtime capability-declaration registry,
  which is PR1.9's job, not this one's.
- **`operation`** — `yuzu::server::authz::Operation`. ADR-0033 §2 names "the existing six" as
  Read/Write/Execute/Delete/Approve/Push. `Attest` is a seventh, narrower operation
  (`rbac_store.cpp` seed comment: Periodic Access Reviews, SOC 2 CC6.2) — deliberately excluded from
  every CRUD loop there, and included in this model's enum for the same reason: a capability can
  genuinely declare it.
- **`risk_tier`** — `yuzu::server::authz::RiskTier` (Low/Medium/High/Critical). The routing input
  ADR-0033 §5 (D5)'s future auto-approval policy layer will consume; the ADR does not fix concrete
  thresholds (D5 is explicitly future work), so this is a deliberately small, ordered scale captured
  from day one rather than a speculative rule language. `min_risk_tier_for(operation)` is the one
  rule this PR commits to: a **floor**, so a capability cannot under-declare the risk of an
  inherently sensitive operation class (Delete/Approve/Push floor at High; Write/Execute/Attest at
  Medium; Read at Low). Declaring above the floor is always fine.
- **`mcp_tier_class`** — `yuzu::server::authz::McpTierClass` (read/write/execute). ADR-0033 §2: the
  routing input PR1.9 **will** feed into the shipped **tier-before-RBAC** ordering
  (`docs/mcp-server.md`, `mcp_policy.hpp::tier_allows`) so every built-in and declared tool routes
  through one chokepoint, extended, never a parallel one. **Not wired today** — `tier_allows` still
  takes a `std::string_view` and has no knowledge of this type. This is deliberately **not** derived purely from
  `operation` in general: ADR-0033 §1 is explicit that read-vs-effect ("the one typing that must not
  be self-certified") is core's *ratified* mutability class, decided when a Module's capability
  manifest is approved. `default_mcp_tier_class(operation)` is only a convenience for classifying
  this header's own seed catalogue below.

### The PR1.9-facing declaration schema

`CapabilityDeclaration` is the per-capability record PR1.9's registration path will populate. It
carries the securable×operation×risk_tier×mcp_tier_class quadruple this PR defines, plus the fields
ADR-1005/ADR-0032 require of **every** capability — the versioned REST twin, the MCP twin (or a
recorded ADR-1005 ledger exception), the `/api/v1/openapi.json` + MCP `tools/list` discovery entry,
the A4 error envelope, agentic-context annotations (track 2g), and `data_class` + `audit_verb`
(ADR-0032 Decision 11). This schema **references** those obligations as fields to populate at
registration — it does not redefine the platform mechanisms themselves, which stay governed by
ADR-1005/ADR-0032 and `rest_a4_envelope.hpp`.

`CapabilityDeclaration::is_valid()` **expresses** ADR-0033 §2's "undeclared means the capability
does not exist — never defaults to read": a missing `securable`/`discovery_entry`/`data_class`/
`audit_verb`, a `risk_tier` below its operation's floor, or **either** REST/MCP twin absent with no
recorded exception all fail validation. Once PR1.9 adds the registration path, a Module registration
that fails it must not register on **any** surface.

**It enforces nothing today.** `is_valid()` has zero production callers — the whole §2 half of
`authz_model.hpp` is reachable only from `test_authz_model.cpp`. That is the deliberate
shipped-incomplete state this section's own opening states ("the model does not enforce anything");
the future tense above is load-bearing, because a reader who takes this as a live control would
believe a capability registration is validated when nothing calls the validator.

There is deliberately **no `execute_roles` field** (or any role-shaped field) — which principals
hold `operation` on `securable` stays entirely in `RbacStore`'s `role_permissions` table. This model
classifies a capability; it never grants one.

### Seed catalogue

`kSeedCatalogue` is five representative rows, not a full mirror of `RbacStore`'s 21 securables × 7
operations — it exists so PR1.9 has real rows to migrate and so this header's own tests exercise
`is_valid`, not to be the registry itself. It includes an ordinary CRUD read (`Response:Read`), a
`Tag:Write` (mirrors `mcp_policy.hpp`'s existing Tag special-case), `Execution:Execute` (the
combination the #1788 fix below narrows), the Guardian-only `Push` narrow op
(`GuaranteedState:Push`), and — required by this PR's spec — `AccessReview:Attest`, deliberately
outside every CRUD loop, exactly as seeded in `rbac_store.cpp`.

### Composition with the frozen #1715 lattice

This model **never re-decides** the frozen #1715 combining lattice or the single INV-7 resolver
`RbacStore` already ships (cross-boundary combining is additive/OR; a global allow overrides a group
deny; a global deny does not override a group allow; deny-overrides applies only within a single
group). It classifies securables/operations/risk-tiers and composes strictly on top, via
`RbacStore`'s existing public API (`check_permission`, `visible_agents_for_permission`,
`check_scoped_permission`, `authorize_list_read`) — never the private `resolve_perm_groups`/
`PermGroups`.

## 2. Closing #1788: per-device visibility on every operator dispatch arm

### The gap

`/api/command` (`server.cpp`, referenced at the handler's `#1788` comment) base-gates a single,
possibly-**global** `Execution:Execute` permission and then dispatches through one of four arms:

1. **Ids** — an explicit `agent_ids` list.
2. **Broadcast** — the published `__all__` ground scope.
3. **Group** — `group:<id>`, resolved via `ManagementGroupStore::get_members`.
4. **Scope** — a scope DSL expression, resolved via `AgentRegistry::evaluate_scope`.

None of the four narrowed the actual send set to the operator's own visibility. This has **one
live consequence and one forward-wired one**, which the fix below deliberately closes together:

- **Live (the exploit #1788 actually closes):** a **service-scoped token** reaches this route because
  `require_permission` admits it via the `ITServiceOwner` role's `Execution:Execute` grant —
  independent of the minting principal's own grants (`auth_routes.cpp`
  `check_role_has_permission("ITServiceOwner", …)`). So before this fix the token dispatched to the
  whole fleet through any arm, most directly by naming a foreign-service device in `agent_ids`,
  ignoring the very confinement `require_scoped_permission` enforces per-target on the non-generic
  paths. (Separately, because the minter *may* also hold a global `Execution:Execute` grant, the
  visibility composition below checks the service scope **first** — CDX-001 — so that grant cannot
  make the token unfiltered.)
- **Forward-wired (correct-but-currently-unreachable):** a purely **management-group-confined**
  operator holds *no* global `Execution:Execute` grant, so the base `require_permission` gate above
  **already denies them** before any arm runs (ADR-0017 records this as the World-A "correct-but-
  unreachable" gap). The per-agent narrowing below therefore changes nothing for that principal
  *today*; it composes correctly for when the ADR-0017 list-admit gate (#1714/#1715) makes such a
  caller reachable. The changelog should not be read as evidence a live management-group exploit was
  closed — it was not; the service-token arm is the live fix.

### The fix

`server.cpp` derives **one** permission-specific visible set — `yuzu::server::authz::VisibleSet`,
`std::nullopt` meaning "unfiltered" — right after the existing destructive-action block and before
any dispatch arm runs:

- A **service-scoped token** (`Session::token_scope_service` non-empty) is resolved **first** and is
  **never unfiltered**: it attenuates to exactly its own service's agents
  (`TagStore::agents_with_tag("service", …)`), and that confinement takes precedence over any global
  `Execution:Execute` grant the minting username holds (an administrator minting a service-A token
  must still be confined to service A, not reach the whole fleet — CDX-001). The tag store being
  unavailable fails closed to the empty set.
- Otherwise, if the operator holds `Execution:Execute` **globally** (`RbacStore::check_permission`),
  or reaches the route via JIT admin elevation (`auth::is_elevated`) — both of which
  `require_permission` above already treats as full access without a matching `principal_roles` row —
  the set is unfiltered. This mirrors `RbacStore::check_scoped_permission`'s own internal order
  (global first) so a global ALLOW keeps overriding a group deny (#1715(b)), rather than this fix
  inventing a second, divergent order.
- Otherwise, the set is `RbacStore::visible_agents_for_permission(user, "Execution", "Execute",
  mgmt_store)` — the ADR-0017 per-agent visible set. Any store error narrows to "nothing visible",
  never "everything" (fail-closed).

Every dispatch arm then intersects its own already-resolved target list against this set via the
shared, pure `yuzu::server::authz::in_scope` / `filter_to_scope` primitives before calling
`send_to`:

- **Ids** — `agent_ids` is filtered directly.
- **Group** — each resolved member is checked before `send_to`.
- **Scope** — `evaluate_scope`'s matched ids are filtered directly.
- **Broadcast** (both the named `__all__` arm and the untargeted-omission fallthrough, #2500) — a
  shared `dispatch_broadcast` closure sends to `AgentRegistry::send_to_all` only when unfiltered;
  otherwise it walks the currently-known agent ids (`AgentRegistry::to_json_obj`) and sends only to
  those in scope.

A hidden id is **silently dropped**, the same posture the Scope/Group arms already had for an id
that resolves to nothing (a 503 "failed to send command to any agent" only if the visibility filter
empties the *entire* resolved set) — this fix narrows the send set, it does not add a new error
shape.

### Where the decision lives, and which surfaces route through it

Two functions, each with exactly one implementation:

| | Function | Decides |
|---|---|---|
| Which arm | `classify_dispatch_arm` (`dispatch_target_shape.hpp`) | Group / Scope / Ids / Broadcast / None |
| Who is reached | `dispatch_confined_arms` (`dispatch_confined_arms.hpp`) | the per-arm `VisibleSet` intersection |

Every OPERATOR dispatch surface reaches the second through one of two callers —
`ServerImpl::dispatch_confined` (the shared closure behind MCP `execute_instruction` /
`execute_bundle`, the dashboard execute and TAR `purge_source` routes, and
`POST /api/instructions|workflows/{id}/execute`) or the `/api/command` inline handler. Those two
callers legitimately differ in how they RESOLVE targets (management-group store, scope engine,
principal from a live session versus an execution row) and in how they report failure
(`/api/command` answers 400/503; the shared closure has no response object — background runners call
it). They do not differ in who gets reached, and that is the part now held in one place.

Each surface supplies the caller's set via an `ExecVisibleFn`, derived per request by
`derive_exec_visible`. **An unwired `ExecVisibleFn` substitutes a PRESENT-EMPTY set, never
`nullopt`** — deny-all rather than unfiltered. That asymmetry is the whole fail-closed contract: the
two states are not interchangeable, and treating a missing derivation as "no filter" is precisely
the failure mode being guarded.

`broadcast_on_none` is the one thing a caller parameterises: it says what an UNNAMED target means.
The shared closure passes `false` — no target named reaches NOBODY (#2500). Callers whose UI or tool
has already normalised a deliberate whole-fleet selection into empty+empty pass `true`. A new
dispatch caller passes `false` and names `__all__` explicitly.

One deliberate exclusion: the BACKGROUND engines (scheduler, Guardian push, policy evaluator)
dispatch as system with `nullopt`, deferred to the #1714/#1715 core chokepoint.

`quarantine_device` is NOT an unfiltered exclusion — both the MCP tool and the REST twin
(`POST`/`DELETE /api/v1/quarantine`) gate on the SOLE per-target `scoped_perm_fn("Security","Execute",
agent_id)` (CDX-P1-02 brought REST to parity with MCP, which already threads a `{agent_id}` confined
`VisibleSet`), and both fail CLOSED — a 500/`kInternalError` — when the scope gate is unwired, never
widening to a global grant. `GET /api/v1/quarantine` is scoped the same way (gov-fix, admit-then-filter
per record via the same `scoped_perm_fn`): a device outside the caller's visible set is dropped from
the list entirely, not merely blocked from write access — closing the asymmetry where a confined
operator could act on a device via POST/DELETE but not see it via GET, and a global `Security:Read`
holder could enumerate devices outside every caller's actionable scope.

### What this fix deliberately preserves

- Every `dispatch_target_shape.hpp` invariant: `__all__` is still the one published spelling of
  broadcast and is **never inferred** from an omitted target; a targeting argument that was
  **supplied** but resolves to nothing is still refused as a 400 before any arm runs (unchanged —
  this fix only touches what happens *after* a target set is already resolved).
- The frozen #1715/INV-7 precedence — this fix calls `RbacStore`'s public resolver-backed API and
  composes on top; it does not touch `rbac_store.{hpp,cpp}` and never reaches the private
  `resolve_perm_groups`.
- The existing destructive-action securable-elevation block (`kDestructiveActionSecurable`), which
  is untouched; its own `ManagementGroupStore`-based `agent_ids` filtering for the destructive-action
  list runs first, and this fix's visibility filter composes on top of whatever `agent_ids` block
  leaves behind (intersecting twice is idempotent).

## Testing

`tests/unit/server/test_authz_model.cpp` covers:

- `CapabilityDeclaration::is_valid()` against the seed catalogue and deliberately-invalid rows.
- Composition semantics (`visible_agents_for_permission` / `check_scoped_permission` /
  `authorize_list_read`) for `Execution:Execute` specifically, mirroring
  `test_list_read_confinement.cpp`'s fixture pattern, including the global-allow-overrides-group-deny
  and global-deny-does-not-override-group-allow #1715 cases.
- `in_scope`/`filter_to_scope` directly, exercising each of the four dispatch arms' characteristic
  target-set shape (an explicit id list, resolved group members, scope-matched ids, and the full
  known-agent-id list for broadcast) against a scoped visible set, and against `std::nullopt`
  (unfiltered).

The arms themselves are covered separately, and both layers are needed. The tests above cover the
shared `in_scope`/`filter_to_scope` PRIMITIVE; `tests/unit/server/test_dispatch_confined_arms.cpp`
covers the per-arm SEAM (`server/core/src/dispatch_confined_arms.hpp`) by running it against a
recording sink and asserting the exact set of agents reached, for every arm against each of the
three `VisibleSet` states.

Proving the primitive correct says nothing about whether every arm actually calls it — that gap is
what previously let route mocks pass while the intersection was deleted from production. The seam
tests are mutation-checked against exactly that: removing any single `in_scope`/`filter_to_scope`
call fails them.

Route-level tests additionally prove the HANDOFF — that each handler derives the caller's visible
set and threads it in — for the MCP, REST-bundle, dashboard, instruction-execute and
workflow-execute surfaces. Handoff plus intersection together is the full path; either alone is not.
