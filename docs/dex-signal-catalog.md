# DEX Signal Catalogue

The Guardian DEX observer collects **103 reliability / employee-experience
signals** (wave 1: 20, wave 2: +50, wave 3: +33) from Windows endpoints as
ruleless observations (`rule_id = "__observation__"`, `event_type` = the
obs_type below). One catalogue-driven engine (`agents/core/src/dex_observer.cpp`)
arms one kernel-filtered `EvtSubscribe` per channel (22 channels); the signal
set, field extraction, privacy minimisations, and per-type rate caps all live
in `agents/core/src/dex_signal_catalog.cpp`. **Adding a signal is one catalogue
entry + one extractor + fixtures — zero server change** (the projection reads
the uniform `detail_json` keys generically, the `/dex` signal panel GROUP-BYs
whatever types exist, and unknown types render with a raw-label fallback under
"Other"). The dashboard groups the catalogue into 13 display groups; the
server-side mirror is `dex_signal_groups()` in `dex_routes.cpp` — keep it in
sync (the paired drift-net tests fail loudly if not). The server display
catalogue totals **107** entries: the 103 Windows event-catalogue types **+
`storage.low`** (one display entry, now emitted by all three platforms from
separate sources — the macOS IOKit poll, the Windows state poll, and the Linux
`/proc`+`statvfs` collector, see those sections below; it began macOS-only) **+
the three A3 `perf.*` sustained-breach types** (`perf.cpu_sustained`,
`perf.memory_pressure`, `perf.disk_latency_high` — the "Performance" display
family, Windows state poll + the Linux `/proc` poll for cpu_sustained &
memory_pressure; disk_latency_high stays Windows-only, see below).
The Windows *event* catalogue stays 103; the state-poll signals (`storage.low`,
battery via `hw.error`, the `perf.*` breaches) ride alongside it without
catalogue entries, exactly like the macOS and Linux poll mechanisms.

Channels that do not exist on a given SKU fail to arm individually and are
logged + skipped (per-channel isolation; e.g. PushNotifications-Platform is
absent on some builds) — the catalogue row then honestly reads zero for that
device while other devices still report.

## Uniform observation shape

Every signal maps onto the same shape — on the wire (`detail_json`), in the
projection (`guardian_observations`), and in the dashboard:

| Field | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `subject` | The failing entity | `chrome.exe`, `Spooler`, `HQ-Laser-3`, `KB5055555`, `CorpNet` |
| `reason` | Machine-ish failure code | `0xC0000005`, `0x80070643`, `7031`, `timeout` |
| `symbolic` | Human name for reason | `ACCESS_VIOLATION`, `WIFI_DISCONNECT` |
| `component` | Secondary entity | `ntdll.dll` (faulting module), NIC description, MAC |
| `metric` | Numeric payload where the signal IS a number | boot duration ms |

`process.crashed` additionally dual-emits the legacy slice-1 keys
(`process`/`exception_code`/`faulting_module`) for the PR #1311 transition;
remove once that window closes.

## Wave 1 — the first 20 signals

| # | obs_type | Channel / Provider / Event IDs | DEX meaning | Cap (events/h) | Privacy minimisation | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `process.crashed` | Application / Application Error / 1000 | App crash | 120 | `AppPath` never extracted | **live** (canary + real Win11 record) |
| 2 | `process.hung` | Application / Application Hang / 1002 | App not responding | 120 | — | fixture |
| 3 | `service.crashed` | System / Service Control Manager / 7031, 7034 | Service died unexpectedly | 60 | — | fixture + UAT canary |
| 4 | `service.start_failed` | System / Service Control Manager / 7000 | Service failed to start | 60 | — | fixture + UAT canary |
| 5 | `os.bugcheck` | System / WER-SystemErrorReporting **and** BugCheck / 1001 | BSOD | 30 | — | fixture |
| 6 | `os.power_loss` | System / Kernel-Power / 41 | Unexpected reboot (6008 deliberately excluded — co-fires with 41, would double-count) | 30 | — | fixture |
| 7 | `display.driver_reset` | System / Display / 4101 | GPU TDR (screen freeze/flash) | 60 | — | fixture |
| 8 | `hw.error` | System / WHEA-Logger / any id, Level ≤ 3 | Hardware (CPU/PCIe/memory) error | 30 | — | fixture |
| 9 | `disk.error` | System / disk / 7, 11, 51, 153 | Failing disk I/O (bad block / controller / paging / retried) | 30 | — | **real record** (event 11 added after a live box showed its disk failures land there) |
| 10 | `fs.corruption` | System / Ntfs **and** Microsoft-Windows-Ntfs / 55 | Filesystem corruption | 30 | — | fixture |
| 11 | `memory.exhausted` | System / Resource-Exhaustion-Detector / 2004 | Commit-charge exhaustion | 12 | — | fixture |
| 12 | `os.boot` | Diagnostics-Performance/Operational / 100 | Boot duration (ms, every boot — trendable) | 30 | — | fixture |
| 13 | `update.failed` | System / WindowsUpdateClient / 20 | Patch install failure | 30 | KB title kept (corp patch info) | fixture |
| 14 | `app_install.failed` | Application / MsiInstaller / 11708 | MSI install failure | 60 | — | fixture |
| 15 | `logon.temp_profile` | Application / User Profiles Service / 1511, 1508 | Temp profile / profile load failure | 12 | **username never extracted** | fixture |
| 16 | `gpo.failed` | System / GroupPolicy / 1125, 1129 | Group Policy processing failure | 12 | — | fixture |
| 17 | `network.wifi_drop` | WLAN-AutoConfig/Operational / 8003 | Wi-Fi disconnect (reason text kept) | 60 | SSID kept (network infra) | fixture |
| 18 | `network.dns_timeout` | System / DNS Client Events / 1014 | Name resolution failing | 30 | **queried hostname never extracted** (browsing behavior) | fixture |
| 19 | `network.ip_conflict` | System / Tcpip / 4199 | IP address conflict | 12 | — | fixture |
| 20 | `print.failed` | PrintService/Admin / 372 | Print failure (top helpdesk driver) | 60 | **document name + owner never extracted**; printer kept | fixture |

"fixture" = the extractor is pinned by a unit fixture encoding the provider's
manifest field layout; field-name drift on a real box degrades gracefully
(empty `subject`, occurrence still counted).

**Real-record verification (2026-06-10):** full-chain fixtures captured from a
live Win11 26100 box now pin `process.crashed` (slice 1), `service.crashed`
(7031), `service.start_failed` (7000 incl. the `%%1053` message-resource form),
`os.power_loss` (41), `os.boot` (100, 64.9 s boot), `update.failed` (20),
`app_install.failed` (11708), `network.wifi_drop` (8003 — **Level 4**, which is
why that spec carries no level filter), and `disk.error` (11). `process.hung`
is canary-verified through the live pipeline (synthetic 1002). Still
manifest-pinned (no local specimen exists — they require a BSOD, hardware
fault, FS corruption, DNS outage, etc.): `os.bugcheck`, `display.driver_reset`,
`hw.error`, `fs.corruption`, `memory.exhausted`, `logon.temp_profile`,
`gpo.failed`, `network.dns_timeout`, `network.ip_conflict`, `print.failed` —
each degrades to a counted occurrence if its field layout drifts.

**Dashboard visibility contract:** the `/dex` All-signals panel lists every
catalogued type, fired or not (quiet types as muted real-zero rows), so
operators see what the fleet monitors — `kDexCatalogueOrder` in
`dex_routes.cpp` is the server-side mirror of this table; keep both in sync
when adding a signal.

## Wave 2 — +50 signals (2026-06-10), by display group

Sources marked **real** are pinned by full-chain fixtures captured from a live
Win11 26100 box; the rest are manifest-best-effort and covered by the
whole-catalogue graceful-degradation test (empty/reordered fields → counted
occurrence, never a crash).

## Wave 3 — +33 signals (2026-06-10), the identity / remote-work / management lens

Real-record pins from the live box: Power-Troubleshooter 1 (**WakeDuration ms
metric** → resume-speed trend), User32 1074 (**param7 = initiating user,
dropped**; process basename + reason kept), TPM-WMI 1801 / Biometrics 1014 /
MDM 844 (validating the any-id + level≤2 pattern for providers whose error ids
vary), AAD 1097 (decimal `Error` → HRESULT hex; **ErrorMessage never shipped —
can embed UPNs**).

| Group | New types |
|---|---|
| Boot, start-up & shutdown | `boot.fast_startup_failed` (Kernel-Boot 29), `os.resume_report` (Power-Troubleshooter 1, metric), `os.restart_initiated` (User32 1074, user dropped) |
| System stability | `os.shadow_copies_lost` (volsnap 25), `os.crashdump_disabled` (volmgr 46), `display.dwm_exited` (DWM 9009) |
| App reliability | `process.file_access_failure` (1005, file path dropped), `app.push_notification_error` (WPN any-err), `app.file_association_reset` (Shell-Core 62), `app.staterepo_error` (StateRepository any-err) |

| Policy & management | `gpo.cse_failed` (GroupPolicy 1085), `mgmt.mdm_error` (DeviceManagement any-err) — `gpo.failed` moved into this group |

Deliberately still excluded: Security-channel logon events (privilege-gated),
Task Scheduler (channel disabled by default), DCOM 10016 + WMI-Activity 5858
(noise), app start-times / audio glitches / NCSI (need ETW collectors, not
event IDs — collector-gated future work).

## Windows state poll (shipped 2026-06-12 — `dex_win_poll.cpp`)

The event engine is blind to bad *states* the OS never logs: a volume filling
up and a battery wearing out have no Event Log record. `dex_win_poll` is the
Windows analogue of the macOS IOKit poll — a companion thread owned by the
Windows DEX observer (started only when at least one event channel armed),
sleeping to the earliest next-due poll and polling on three cadences with the
same **poll-and-latch** discipline (emit on the transition INTO a bad state,
suppress while it persists, re-arm on recovery; the latch replaces a rate
cap). First poll on the first tick, never at-arm. BRD rows 20–21
(`docs/dex-brd-coverage.md`, slice D1) + rows 13–15/124 (slice A3).

| obs_type | Source | Cadence | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| `storage.low` | `GetDiskFreeSpaceExW` over lettered `DRIVE_FIXED` volumes (per-volume latch; unreadable/locked volumes skipped — never a signal) | 10 min | >= 90% used OR < 5 GiB free (identical to macOS) |
| `hw.error` (subject=`battery`) | battery device interface + `IOCTL_BATTERY_QUERY_INFORMATION` (DesignedCapacity / FullChargedCapacity / CycleCount; `GENERIC_READ` only) | hourly | full-charge < 80% of design (identical to macOS); no battery / zero design capacity never emits |
| `perf.cpu_sustained` | `GetSystemTimes` cumulative busy % (`dex_perf_breach.cpp`) | 120 s sample | avg >= 90% busy for 5 consecutive samples (10 min); re-arm < 70% for 3 |
| `perf.memory_pressure` | `GetPerformanceInfo` commit charge vs limit (commit, not physical RAM — high physical use is normal caching; commit near the limit means allocations fail) | 120 s sample | >= 90% of commit limit for 10 min; re-arm < 80% for 3 samples |
| `perf.disk_latency_high` | `IOCTL_DISK_PERFORMANCE` per-IO service time summed over physical disks (zero IOs in an interval reads 0 ms — an idle disk is healthy) | 120 s sample | avg >= 25 ms/IO for 10 min; re-arm < 15 ms for 3 samples |

The A3 `perf.*` rows (slice A3, 2026-06-12) are **sustained-breach hysteresis**
latches (`dex_perf_breach.{hpp,cpp}`): a breach needs the full sustain window
of consecutive bad samples to fire ONCE with the window average as `metric`,
then re-arms only after consecutive valid samples below the (lower) exit
threshold — flap-proof and bounded at ~4 observations/hour/type worst case. An
invalid sample (read failure, reboot counter reset) resets the streaks but
never clears the latch. Thresholds are hardcoded sane defaults until F1 makes
them operator-tunable (the D3 blast-radius precedent). The A1 TAR perf
warehouse is the *history* of these same counters; this is the *alerting* leg
(the BRD's "real-time + historical + alerting" decomposition).

The decision functions are pure and unit-tested on every host
(`test_dex_win_poll.cpp`, `test_dex_perf_breach.cpp`); the Win32 mechanism is
the impure shell, mirroring the macOS pure-parser/impure-engine split.

## Privacy / works-council contract

Extractors drop user content **at the edge, before anything leaves the
device**: DNS queried names, print document names/owners, profile usernames,
image paths; on Linux, `storage.low` emits the backing-device identifier (`sda1`,
or the ZFS pool), never the mount path. What is never extracted can never be
exfiltrated or mis-scoped.
This is the data-minimisation half of the co-determination posture (see memory
`project-telemetry-privacy-works-council`); the per-device drill-down is
additionally permission-gated and audit-logged server-side. Remaining product
gaps (per-category collection toggles, individual-view kill switch,
pseudonymization, operator-set retention) are tracked as roadmap items, not
solved here.

## Rate caps

Each obs_type carries `max_per_hour`; the engine counts per fixed hour-bucket
and drops the overflow with ONE warn per (type, bucket). Storm-prone providers
(WHEA corrected-error loops, failing disks issuing retry storms, Wi-Fi flaps)
cannot flood the wire or the Guardian event store. Caps are deliberately
generous for genuine incident rates.

## macOS collector (shipped — `dex_macos_collector.cpp`)

The shape is OS-neutral, so the macOS collector reuses the SAME obs_type strings,
the SAME uniform `detail_json` keys, and the SAME wire mapping
(`signal_observation_to_event`) — **zero server or dashboard change**; the
signals render with their existing friendly labels and group under the existing
display groups, with `platform="macos"` driving the by-OS panel. The collector is
a drop-in `ISignalObserver` behind `make_dex_observer()` (`__APPLE__` branch),
using FOUR privilege-light mechanisms that need **neither an Endpoint Security
entitlement nor Full Disk Access** (the agent user's own
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`, the world-readable
`/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`, the unified log via `log show`, and
`diskutil`/`system_profiler` are all readable unprivileged):

1. a **kqueue `EVFILT_VNODE` folder-watch** over both DiagnosticReports
   directories — idle until a report is written, then a rescan parses the new
   file. ReportCrash writes atomically via a hidden `.<name>.ips` temp + rename,
   so the watcher **skips all dotfiles** and only ever reads the final, complete
   report (this avoids a half-written read AND a temp-path/final-path
   double-count);
2. a periodic **`sysctl(KERN_BOOTTIME)`** read → the `os.uptime_report` scalar;
3. a periodic **unified-log poll** (`dex_macos_oslog.{hpp,cpp}`): on the same 60 s
   kqueue timer it runs `log show --start <checkpoint> --predicate <p> --style
   ndjson`, parses each JSON log event, and advances a checkpoint (with a
   boundary-second dedup set for the inclusive `--start`). Deliberately a bounded
   poll, NOT a persistent `log stream` child and NOT the Objective-C `OSLogStore`
   framework — keeps the agent pure C++ and NFR-friendly (~0.7 s/poll; logd does
   the filtering server-side so the agent never sees the firehose). This is the
   macOS analogue of the Windows single `EvtSubscribe` mechanism: it unlocks the
   "an event happened" signals that land in the log rather than in report files;
4. an **IOKit/system-tool poll** (`dex_macos_iokit.{hpp,cpp}`): two cadences —
   hourly `diskutil info` + `system_profiler SPPowerDataType` (battery/SMART,
   slow-changing) and every 10 min `df` + `pmset -g therm` + `memory_pressure -Q`
   (disk/thermal/memory, fluctuating). Emits **only on a transition into a bad
   state** (poll-and-diff: latch on, suppress while it persists, re-arm on
   recovery) — these are STATE not events. Covers Hardware & storage (which the
   unified log doesn't) plus the employee-felt "full / hot / low-memory" states.

The fiddly extraction is in the pure, framework-free `dex_macos_signals.cpp` /
`dex_macos_oslog.cpp` / `dex_macos_iokit.cpp` (an `.ips` is two concatenated JSON
documents; an ndjson log line is one JSON object; `diskutil`/`system_profiler`
output is `Key: value` text), unit-tested on every host (incl. MSVC) against
**real captured records** from a macOS 26.5 / Apple Silicon box
(`test_dex_macos.cpp`).

The signals below reuse existing Windows obs_types wherever one fits (friendly
labels + correct heading for free), giving **coverage of ~10 of the 11 DEX
headings unprivileged**. "live" = seen end-to-end on `/dex`; "real-record" =
parser pinned to a captured record; "best-effort" = parser written to the known
shape, awaiting a real failure specimen (the macOS analogue of the Windows
manifest fixtures — a healthy box has no failures to fire them).

The **11th heading, Security, is reachable unprivileged but not yet shipped**:
XProtect detections and Gatekeeper blocks (→ `security.threat_detected`) live in
the unified log (`XProtect*` / `syspolicyd`, readable without an entitlement —
ESF is NOT required), but a healthy box only logs *scan activity* and unrelated
"blocked" noise, so writing a low-false-positive parser needs a real detection /
block specimen first. It is the next best-effort branch; shipping a guessed
parser now would mistake routine scans for detections.

| Heading | obs_type | macOS source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service/App Health | `process.crashed` | `.ips` crash (309/109/385) | **live** |
| | `service.crashed` | unified log: launchd abnormal exit | **live** |
| | `process.hung` | `.ips` spin/hang (288/388) | fixture |
| | `process.resource_limit` | `.diag` cpu/wakeups/disk-write budget (macOS-only, "Other") | **live** |
| System Stability | `os.bugcheck` | `.ips` kernel panic (210/110) | fixture |
| | `memory.exhausted` | `.ips` JetsamEvent (298, kill) + `memory_pressure -Q` <10% free (warning) | real-record |
| Boot/startup/shutdown | `os.uptime_report` | `sysctl kern.boottime` | **live** |
| Network | `network.wifi_drop` | unified log: symptomsd LQM / data-stall degradation | real-record |
| Updates & installs | `update.failed` | unified log: softwareupdated error/fault | best-effort |
| Printing | `print.failed` | unified log: cupsd error/fault | best-effort |
| Policy & management | `mgmt.mdm_error` | unified log: mdmclient error/fault | best-effort |
| Identity & logon | `logon.no_dc` | unified log: opendirectoryd error/fault | best-effort |
| File system | `fs.corruption` | unified log: `com.apple.apfs` error/fault | best-effort |
| Hardware & storage | `disk.smart_failure` | IOKit poll: `diskutil` SMART != Verified | real-record |
| | `hw.error` (battery) | IOKit poll: `system_profiler` battery condition / capacity <80% | real-record |
| | `storage.low` | IOKit poll: `df` Data volume >=90% full or <5 GiB free ("Disk nearly full"; same obs_type + thresholds as the Windows state poll) | real-record |
| | `hw.cpu_throttled` | IOKit poll: `pmset -g therm` CPU speed cap <100% | real-record |

**Boot duration (deliberately NOT shipped):** macOS exposes boot *start*
(`kern.boottime`) but no clean unprivileged boot-*complete* marker — the UI-ready
events (loginwindow/WindowServer) age out of the unified-log store within days, so
they can't be differenced on a long-uptime machine, and there is no boot-duration
event to parse. Rather than ship a fragile, unvalidatable parser, `os.boot`
(duration) stays Windows-only; the Boot heading carries `os.uptime_report` on
macOS.

**Two fidelity notes (honest, vs Windows):** (1) `service.crashed` — launchd logs
EVERY service exit, not only unexpected ones (Windows SCM 7031/7034 fire only on
unexpected termination), so this is broader; it filters to abnormal exits and the
rate cap clips a flapping service. (2) The error/fault-level system-process
signals (update/print/mdm/logon/fs) are **occurrence-based and tightly
predicated**: macOS over-uses "Error" level, so they fire only on real
daemon-level failures (a routine client error — bad printer, missing user — logs
at Default level and is correctly ignored), and the **raw eventMessage is never
shipped** (it can carry usernames/paths) — only "this subsystem failed on this
device". Lower per-signal richness, but low false-positive and privacy-safe.

**Privacy at the edge (same contract as Windows):** a crash report's `procPath`,
`parentProc`, thread register state, and image paths are NEVER surfaced — only
basenames; OSLog raw messages from sensitive daemons are never shipped. Pinned by
`[dex_macos][privacy]` tests.

**Battery health now has a Windows like-for-like** (the Windows state poll,
2026-06-12): both platforms ride the generic `hw.error` obs_type with
subject="battery" and the same below-80%-of-design threshold, so they render
identically under Hardware without a server change. A dedicated
`hw.battery_degraded` obs_type + label remains a future polish (needs a
`dex_signal_groups()` + drift-net edit).

## Linux collector (shipped — `dex_linux_collector.cpp`, `dex_linux_proc.cpp`, `dex_linux_storage.cpp`)

A drop-in `ISignalObserver` behind `make_dex_observer()` (`__linux__` branch), targeting
**headless Linux servers** with two privilege-light mechanisms (no elevated access):

1. a **periodic `/proc` poll** (`dex_linux_proc.cpp`): `/proc/stat` busy% and `/proc/meminfo`
   commit% feed `perf.cpu_sustained` and `perf.memory_pressure` on the SAME sustained-breach
   hysteresis + thresholds as the Windows state poll (reused `dex_perf_breach`);
2. a **`statvfs` storage poll** (`dex_linux_storage.cpp`): `storage.low` (>=90% used or <5 GiB
   free) over real local block-backed filesystems (ext*/xfs/btrfs/zfs/f2fs; pseudo, read-only
   and network fstypes excluded).

It reuses the existing obs_type strings, uniform `detail_json` keys and wire mapping, so the
signals render in the same `/dex` display groups with **zero server or dashboard change**,
`platform="linux"` driving the by-OS panel. Disk-latency (`perf.disk_latency_high`) is not yet
emitted on Linux; crash/hang/journald reliability signals are a later slice.

**Coverage is Performance + Hardware/storage.** Workstation-only headings (battery, Wi-Fi,
display/WM, GUI app dialogs, .NET) are **N/A on a headless server**, not gaps — score against the
server-applicable denominator.

**`storage.low` subject is the backing-device identifier, NEVER the mount path** — a mount path
carries usernames / tenant / project names (`/home/alice/...`), which must not leave the device
(§Privacy). For a `/dev/*` device that is the basename (`sda1`, `vg0-root`); for a ZFS dataset
(whose `/proc/mounts` source is the dataset path, leaf = per-user) it is the **pool** (`tank`,
`rpool`), never the leaf. Pinned by `[dex][privacy]` tests that call the same
`storage_low_observation` chokepoint the collector calls (subject / sentence / `detail_json`
asserted free of any path component).

**Deployment notes:** `storage.low` uses a fixed 5 GiB-free floor, so small cloud/VM root volumes
can read as low until thresholds are operator-configurable (F1). Inside an **unmodified
container** `/proc` reflects the *host*, so the collector targets host/VM deployment. `statvfs`
excludes network *fstypes*, but a hung local block device (iSCSI/NBD/failing disk) can still stall
the poll — a bounded statvfs is a tracked follow-up.

| Heading | obs_type | Linux source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Performance | `perf.cpu_sustained` | `/proc/stat` busy% >=90% sustained | live |
| Performance | `perf.memory_pressure` | `/proc/meminfo` commit% >=90% | live |
| Hardware & storage | `storage.low` | `statvfs` >=90% used; subject = device/pool | live |

## macOS: what more is possible with ESF / Network Extension / other entitlements

The unprivileged collector above covers ~10 of 11 headings. Acquiring privileges
buys **fidelity and a few otherwise-hard signals — NOT breadth** (breadth is
already reachable). Evidence gathered on the dev box (2026-06-11):

**Endpoint Security** (reachable to *validate* via root + the Apple-shipped
`/usr/bin/eslogger`, which carries `com.apple.developer.endpoint-security.client`
— so ES needs root + FDA, NOT a custom Apple-granted entitlement to prototype;
productionising needs an ES System Extension + that distribution entitlement,
standard for this vendor class). ES exposes **104 event types**. DEX upgrades:
- **Identity & logon — the biggest win:** `login_login/logout`,
  `lw_session_login/logout`, `openssh_login`, `su`, `sudo`, `authentication`,
  `authorization_judgement` — high-fidelity *structured* login/auth events, far
  better than the best-effort opendirectoryd-error signal above.
- **Security:** `xp_malware_detected/remediated` (XProtect), `gatekeeper_user_override`
  — authoritative vs scraping `syspolicy` logs.
- **Policy & management:** `profile_add/remove`.
- **Service/App Health + File system:** `exec`/`exit` (gap-free) + file events —
  mostly *completeness*; the report/log channels already catch user-visible
  failures, so the extra is largely DEX-noise (and a firehose to filter).
- **Cost beyond engineering:** ES gives file-level + real-time login/exec
  visibility — a surveillance-*capability* escalation an EU works council treats
  very differently from reading crash reports (co-determination triggers on
  capability, not intent). Gate behind explicit customer/MDM opt-in.

**Network Extension** (content filter / transparent proxy — entitlement + System
Extension + MDM): the only thing buying *new* network capability — per-flow /
per-app connectivity, **DNS-resolution timing**, latency. Collides with the
no-continuous-streaming NFR (aggregate on-device). Note: much network *experience*
is already unprivileged — `symptomsd` LQM/data-stalls (shipped above) + the
`networkQuality` CLI — so this is only for the deepest per-flow KPIs.

**MetricKit (`MXMetricManager`) — the one we CANNOT have:** the ideal APM feed
(per-app launch time, hang rate, responsiveness, CPU/disk exceptions) is
**per-app opt-in** — no API lets a fleet agent pull it for third-party apps. No
privilege unlocks it. Approximations: agent-side aggregated sampling
(`top`/`proc_pid_rusage`, unprivileged but NFR-heavy) or an embeddable Yuzu SDK.

**Root / privileged IOKit:** `powermetrics` (detailed CPU/GPU/thermal/power),
`spindump` (reliable hangs) — deepen System Stability / Hardware. **MDM authority:**
the authoritative Policy & management source vs scraping `mdmclient`. **Full Disk
Access:** other users' crash reports + full `OSLogStore` history — marginal.

**Bottom line:** privileges deepen Identity/Security/Management fidelity and add
per-flow network + complete process/file telemetry; they do **not** add headings
and are **not required** for the ~10/11 unprivileged coverage. The one hard ceiling
is clean per-app APM (MetricKit), which no entitlement crosses.

Linux: journald-based collectors (coredumpctl, systemd unit failures, OOM
killer) follow the same catalogue pattern.

## Wire + read-model invariants

- **No proto change** for new signals: `detail_json` is keyed by `event_type`
  (route a′); the gateway forwards `GuaranteedStateEvent` opaquely.
- The projection (`guardian_observations`, migration {7}) is written **inside
  the event transaction** — duplicate `event_id` rolls back both (at-least-once
  dedup), and the reaper deletes projection rows in lockstep with events.
- Observations are facts, not alerts: severity is uniformly `info`; DEX applies
  its own framing and ignores Guardian severity.
- The headline dashboard rate stays **crash-free devices** (crash-scoped);
  other signals get their own panels. Rates always pair with coverage
  (reporting Windows agents) and show "—" when the denominator is missing.

## Testing methodology & evidence hygiene

Extractors are verified two ways: pure unit fixtures (the field layouts encoded
from provider manifests / real captured records) and a live **injection sweep**
that writes synthetic events through the real `EvtSubscribe` path to confirm the
end-to-end agent→server→`/dex` flow. Only **classic registered event sources**
can be written this way (`Write-EventLog`); manifest providers
(`Microsoft-Windows-*`) cannot be spoofed — which is also the security property
that makes forged DEX signals hard.

**Evidence-integrity rule (do this only on isolated rigs):** an injection sweep
writes events from sources like `Service Control Manager`, `Tcpip`, `NETLOGON`,
`disk`, and Defender into the host's *real* System/Application logs. On a managed
production endpoint that would contaminate SIEM pipelines, trip EDR/IDS rules (a
synthetic `machine-trust-failed` or threat detection reads as a real attack
indicator), and corrupt forensic evidence. **Run injection sweeps only on
isolated lab/test machines that are not managed endpoints, not ingested by a
customer SIEM, and not a potential forensic-evidence source.** To exercise the
collector on a real endpoint, trigger or wait for *genuine* events (restart a
test service, run a disk check) rather than injecting security-provider events.
