# 0053 — `CaStore` Postgres migration (authoritative, PKI routed-concern, with backfill)

## Context

`CaStore` (`server/core/src/ca_store.{hpp,cpp}`) is the inventory + lifecycle store for Yuzu's
internal CA: the root certificate (metadata only — the private key lives behind `KeyProvider`,
never in this store), the issued-certificate inventory, and the CRL version history. It is a
Wave 3 store on `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md`, listed there as "unblocked" ahead of its
Wave-3 siblings because it holds no envelope-encrypted secret column — `key_ref` is an opaque
`KeyProvider` reference, not key material, so `SecretCodec` is not involved (confirmed below).

This is a PKI routed-concern store (`.claude/routed-concerns.md`): the catastrophic invariants —
key-never-in-the-DB, the shared `sign_agent_csr` signer, and the revoked-status read path staying
fail-closed — are preserved unchanged by this migration; only the storage engine changes.

`CaStore` was previously SQLite (`ca.db`, tables `ca_root`, `ca_issued`, `ca_crl_versions`,
migrations v1–v5) guarded by a single connection mutex, with a second, coarser `crl_publish_mu_`
serialising CRL-number allocation. It is wired live in `server.cpp` (`ca_store_`), consumed by
`ca_routes.cpp` (the `/api/v1/ca/*` REST surface + the Settings CA panel), `mcp_server.cpp`
(`list_issued_certs`/`revoke_certificate`), and `default_certs.cpp` (first-boot bootstrap).

## Decision

**Migrate `CaStore` to PostgreSQL as schema `ca_store`, tables `ca_root`, `ca_issued`,
`ca_crl_versions`, with a standard ADR-0009 first-boot backfill.**

### Schema

Schema name `ca_store` (ADR-0008 Update naming rule). A single consolidated `v1` migration folds
in every column the SQLite store's five migrations (v1–v5) added incrementally — those existed
only to upgrade already-deployed local files; no Postgres database predates this schema, so there
is nothing to incrementally ALTER. The partial index `idx_ca_issued_status ON ca_issued(status)
WHERE status = 'revoked'` carries across as-is (Postgres supports partial indexes natively).
`ca_crl_versions.der` becomes `BYTEA` (was `BLOB`); every other column keeps its pre-migration
type and name unchanged (`TEXT`→`TEXT`, `INTEGER` epoch-seconds/count columns→`BIGINT`).
`serial_hex TEXT PRIMARY KEY` and `ca_root.id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1)` are kept exactly
(pre-migration ID contracts, per the Wave 2/3 lesson).

A new table, `sqlite_backfill_source (fingerprint TEXT PRIMARY KEY, completed_at BIGINT NOT
NULL)`, is the backfill idempotency tracker — not part of the application data model.

### Secrets (ADR-0010) — resolves the Wave 3 "unblocked" note

**Asserted and unchanged by this migration: `key_ref` is the ONLY root-key-adjacent column, and
it is an opaque `KeyProvider` reference (a file path in Milestone 1), never the key itself.** No
column in any of the three tables holds secret material — `cert_pem` values are PUBLIC certs, not
keys. `SecretCodec` is therefore not involved; this store does not belong in a future secrets-seam
wave.

### Posture

**AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard** (ADR-0012 §1), both construction and runtime — the database is the
source of truth for the revoked-certificate set. A silently-empty/-false read on `is_revoked` /
`list_revoked` would silently accept a certificate that should have been rejected, or publish a
CRL that omits a real revocation — exactly the fail-open shape ADR-0036 exists to close. Every
reader/mutator whose false/empty result could feed that class of decision returns
`std::expected<..., std::string>`, prefixed `kCaDbErrorPrefix` ("`db_error: `") on a genuine
DB/lease failure — **with one deliberate, documented exception: `is_revoked()`**.

#### `is_revoked()` stays a plain `bool`, fails closed to `true`

This is the mTLS-accept security gate (`ServerImpl::is_peer_cert_revoked`), on the per-heartbeat/
Subscribe/Register-reauth hot path. Rather than expose a third ("couldn't tell") state a caller
could accidentally fold into "not revoked," every degradation mode — a non-hex serial (pre-
existing), a lease timeout, a query error (both new failure modes a networked Postgres substrate
makes far more likely than a local SQLite file) — returns `true`: "treat as revoked, refuse."
This mirrors `ApiTokenStore::validate_token`'s existing hot-path-degrades-to-the-safe-answer
precedent (both are auth-gate reads with the same shape). The catastrophic-if-violated PKI
invariant this store's kickoff cited verbatim: *"Degrade → error → treat as revoked / refuse,
never silent-pass."*

**Operational consequence, stated explicitly:** during a sustained Postgres outage, every
heartbeat/Subscribe/Register-reauth is rejected fleet-wide, not just genuinely-revoked agents.
Since the return value alone cannot distinguish "the DB is down" from "a real mass-revocation
sweep," `is_revoked()` emits a distinct, explicit log line on every degraded-path return
(`CaStore::is_revoked: database unavailable ... this is a DEGRADED-DB rejection, NOT a real
revocation`) so an operator diagnosing mass rejection has the signal in hand without having to
infer it.

#### `list_revoked()` — type-distinguishable, and its callers must abort, never proceed on empty

`list_revoked()` feeds CRL construction (`publish_crl()`'s revoked-set) and the PR3 HIGH-2
re-issue-block guard (`sign_agent_csr`'s scan for an existing revoked, non-expired cert on the
requesting `agent_id`). A silently-empty read on either call site is dangerous in a DIFFERENT way
than `is_revoked`'s own degradation: it does not merely deny one request, it can (a) publish a CRL
that claims nobody is revoked when real revocations exist (un-revoking every cert in every cache
that trusts that CRL), or (b) let a revocation-bypass re-enrollment through — the exact bug class
HIGH-2 (#1239) closed. Both `server.cpp` call sites were updated to treat a `list_revoked()`
`unexpected` as an abort signal (refuse to publish / refuse to issue), never as "empty means
nothing is revoked."

#### Revocation-sweep tick — reads the revoked set once per tick, aborts on a degraded read

The ~15s tick that tears down any live Subscribe stream whose agent leaf has since been revoked
does **not** call the fail-closed `is_revoked()` once per live agent. `is_revoked()`'s
fail-closed-to-`true` shape is correct for a single bounded mTLS accept, but reused once per live
agent inside a sweep it turns a transient Postgres outage into "every enrolled agent was just
revoked" — every stream torn down, and a `session.cert_revoked` audit row written for each: a
durable false compliance record, not merely an availability blip. The sweep instead reads the
revoked-serial set **once per tick** via a dedicated, cheap, unlabeled read
(`CaStore::list_revoked_serials()` — same WHERE clause and partial index as `list_revoked()`, but
no `cert_pem`/`ORDER BY`, so it stays cheap independent of `list_revoked()`'s own growth) and
**aborts the sweep entirely** on a degraded read — logs, increments
`yuzu_server_ca_revocation_sweep_read_failures_total`, and leaves every live stream untouched
rather than treating a read failure as mass revocation. The per-request gate (`is_peer_cert_revoked`)
is unchanged — still fails closed for its own bounded accept — so an agent revoked immediately
before an outage keeps its live stream for the outage's duration (no *new* access is granted; the
sweep is defense-in-depth on top of the per-request gate, not the only enforcement point).
`list_revoked()` itself is deliberately left reading the full row set for its own two callers
(CRL publish, the reissue-block guard): both fail CLOSED and LOUD on a degraded read already (an
operator-visible enrollment failure / an aborted publish with its own failure counter), which is
a materially different risk than the sweep's original fail-OPEN-and-silent shape — fixing only the
sweep is neither an under- nor an over-fix.

#### Root-singleton first-boot race (the one genuinely new problem)

Under per-instance SQLite this race never existed — each server instance held its own local
`ca.db`. A shared Postgres substrate makes it possible for two instances to independently generate
CA root material (their own key, their own self-signed cert, their own three default leaves,
written to their own local cert directory via `FileKeyProvider`) and race to establish it as
canonical.

**Resolution — split the write API:**

- **`try_insert_root(root)`** — the NEW, race-safe first-boot entry point. `INSERT ... ON
  CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING ...`: at most one caller's row is ever inserted. Every
  caller, winner or loser, reads back the SAME row that is now canonical — the loser does **not**
  get told "you lost" as a bare boolean; it gets handed the actual winning `CaRoot`, and MUST
  compare its returned fingerprint against what it generated to learn which happened (never
  locally infer "I won" from anything but the returned value).
- **`set_root(root)`** — kept, unconditional REPLACE (`ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE`), the
  pre-migration `INSERT OR REPLACE` contract verbatim. Used by the two callers that legitimately
  intend a replace: PR6 subordinate-CA import (`ServerImpl::import_subordinate_chain` — an
  explicit, single-writer, operator-triggered re-root of an ALREADY-established root) and test
  seeding. **Never called from first-boot generation** — porting `set_root`'s semantics onto that
  path (as a naive migration might) would have the RACE LOSER silently clobber the winner's root
  with its own, orphaning the winner's already-enrolled agents in the instant between — the
  precise wrong outcome kickoff flagged.

**The loser's side (`default_certs.cpp`):** a losing caller has already generated complete,
unusable key material (nobody else holds its private key). What this migration guarantees is
DB-level: **exactly one root is ever established**, and every other racer fails closed — it never
writes its own material as though it were authoritative, and never silently operates under, or
overwrites, a root it doesn't recognise. Multi-replica HA over one shared `ca_store` Postgres +
one shared `--ca-dir` volume is **not an officially supported deployment topology today** (see
"Self-heal" below); a single-instance-per-directory deployment never reaches this branch at all,
since `try_insert_root` only ever contends against itself in that shape.

**Tested** (`try_insert_root — a losing caller reads back the winner, never clobbers it`,
`[ca_store][pg][root][security]`): two `try_insert_root` calls with distinct root material against
the same store — the second call returns the FIRST call's root verbatim (fingerprint and
`cert_pem`), and a subsequent `get_root()` confirms the stored row is still exactly the winner's.

#### Self-heal and the bootstrap advisory lock

An established install (`ca_store` already holds a root) whose on-disk default-cert set is
missing, incomplete, or corrupt — a crash mid-bootstrap, a bad partial restore, a lost volume
file — self-heals rather than requiring the heavyweight "clean re-root" operator runbook: if the
local CA key still resolves at the exact path `ca_store`'s root recorded, AND cryptographically
pairs with that root's cert (`pki::cert_matches_key`), this instance re-mints the three default
leaves under the SAME root. This is directory access to the material that minted the root, not a
standalone proof of instance identity — every process sharing the same cert directory (a shared
volume across HA replicas, or a self-heal resumer racing an original instance that is merely slow
rather than dead) satisfies it identically. Two mechanisms keep this safe under that ambiguity:

- **A Postgres session advisory lock** (`yuzu:default_certs_bootstrap`, non-blocking try + bounded
  retry) serializes every entry into the purge-and-regenerate critical section — both the normal
  winning-the-race path and the self-heal path route through the same lock, and re-validate
  (`try_use_existing_complete_set`) once inside it in case a sibling finished while this instance
  waited. A liveness round-trip on the lock-holding connection runs immediately before the
  completion marker is written, closing the gap where the connection dies mid-critical-section
  (killed, idle-reaped, network-blackholed) without the process dying — Postgres releases the
  session lock the instant that connection ends, and nothing else would otherwise notice.
- **Cert/key-pairing verification on every idempotent fast-path check** (not just chain
  verification) means a mismatched pair that lands on disk despite the lock — from any cause —
  self-heals on the very next boot instead of validating as intact forever.
- **The CA private key is written to disk only after a candidate is confirmed the sole winner** of
  `try_insert_root`'s CAS, never speculatively beforehand — multiple simultaneous candidates on a
  shared directory would otherwise all race to write the same well-known `default-ca.key` path,
  and whichever write lands last silently detaches the established root from its real private key
  regardless of which candidate actually won the CAS, permanently defeating every future self-heal
  attempt for that root.

**A losing racer polls the shared cert directory for the winner's complete set (UP-3)** for up to
15s before falling back to refusing boot — the winner's completion marker is written last, so a
partial/in-flight write is never adopted. This turns "needs a restart to pick up the winner's
certs" into "self-heals within the same boot attempt" for the common case; a winner that hasn't
finished within the window (contention, a slow Postgres) still falls back to the original
fail-closed-and-restart behavior, never a hang.

#### `has_root()` / `get_root()` split — two callers needed the typed channel, two did not

`get_root()` becomes `std::expected<std::optional<CaRoot>, std::string>`. A NEW `has_root()`
convenience collapses a degraded read to `false` — kept **only** for the two production call
sites genuinely safe with that collapse: a background CRL-freshness-sweep tick skipping
harmlessly, and the `/readyz` `ca_root` signal, where "can't prove a root exists" SHOULD read as
unhealthy anyway. Two other call sites needed the typed channel instead:

- `default_certs.cpp`'s B-2 guard ("never silently re-root a populated CA," #1238) calls
  `get_root()` directly and fails closed (refuses to proceed) on a genuine read error — collapsing
  this ONE call site's degraded read to "no root" would let a fresh CA generation proceed and
  silently re-root a fleet that already has one, precisely the danger B-2 exists to prevent.
- **`server.cpp`'s boot-time PKI wiring block** (the `run()` code that wires the per-agent cert
  signer, the revocation checker, and the peer-cert recognizer) was **initially left on
  `has_root()`** in this migration's first two commits — an oversight caught by adversarial review
  (Kimi + Codex, both independently, 2026-08-20), not by the author. `has_root()`'s collapse turns
  a transient Postgres lease/query failure at this ONE call site into "no root," which silently
  skips wiring the revocation checker for the rest of the process's life — no retry, no periodic
  re-check. A revoked Yuzu-issued agent cert would then pass `Register`/`Subscribe`/heartbeat
  unchecked until the next restart: a fail-open security regression, and exactly the ADR-0036
  reviewer test this store's OTHER read paths were built to satisfy ("could a silently-false read
  gate a downstream grant/enforce/skip decision? If yes, fail closed, never empty") — just missed
  on this one call site. **Fixed**: the block now calls `get_root()` directly; an `unexpected` sets
  `startup_failed_ = true` and returns from `run()` immediately — this call site runs BEFORE
  `BuildAndStart()`, so nothing is listening yet, matching the bare-`return`-on-failure precedent
  the TLS-credential checks a few dozen lines below already use at this same pre-`BuildAndStart`
  point in `run()` (no listener to tear down, unlike the later SCIM-boot-failure recheck, which
  fires AFTER `BuildAndStart()` and so needs the heavier `stop()` call to close what is already
  open). A genuinely-empty root (`nullopt` — operator brought their own certs) is unchanged: skip
  wiring, no signer, same pre-PKI contract as before.

### Write-path failure classification (#3097 precedent)

- **`record_issued`** — `std::expected<void, std::string>`. A PG unique-violation (SQLSTATE
  `23505`) on `ca_issued.serial_hex` is classified distinctly, prefixed `kCaDuplicateSerialPrefix`
  ("`duplicate_serial: `"), separate from `kCaDbErrorPrefix` — resolves the #1276 flake lead
  (kickoff item 2). **Finding:** `x509_ca` mints a random 128-bit serial per issuance
  (`x509_ca.hpp`), so a genuine production collision is astronomically unlikely; no repro of a
  real collision was found in this migration's test fixtures or in the current tree. The
  classification is real infrastructure regardless — a future caller can retry issuance with a
  freshly-minted serial on this specific error rather than treating it as an outage — but this
  narrows, rather than closes, #1276: the flake is more likely a test-fixture serial reuse than a
  live collision, and is left open for whoever last touched it to close or re-scope with this
  finding in hand.
- **`revoke`** — `std::expected<bool, std::string>`. `Ok(true)` = transitioned; `Ok(false)` = a
  genuine, successful business answer (unknown/already-revoked — audited `result=denied`, per
  `docs/pki-architecture.md`'s existing taxonomy); `unexpected` = a genuine DB/lease failure,
  audited `result=failure` and surfaced as REST 503 / MCP `kInternalError` — **never folded into
  `denied`**, which would falsely record a database outage as a rejected revoke attempt (a false
  compliance record). `ca_routes.cpp`'s `RevokeOutcome` enum gained a `StoreError` member
  alongside the existing `NotFound`/`RevokedCrlStale`/`RevokedCrlPublished`, mapped to 503 on both
  the REST and dashboard-wrapper revoke handlers; `mcp_server.cpp`'s `revoke_certificate` handler
  mirrors the same three-way split.
- **`next_crl_number`** — `std::expected<std::uint64_t, std::string>`. The pre-migration SQLite
  version silently returned `1` on ANY read error — safe by accident under SQLite (a stray `1`
  either collides loudly against `record_crl`'s duplicate-refusal once real CRLs exist, or is
  merely stale-but-harmless before any CRL has ever been published) but unsafe to carry forward
  once the table can hold real cross-boot history: `server.cpp`'s `publish_crl()` now aborts the
  whole publish attempt on a `next_crl_number` error rather than substituting a default.

### CRL version continuity (kickoff item 4 — stated explicitly)

The CRL sequence must not regress or fork across cutover. Three parts:

1. **Backfill resumes above the legacy max, never regresses to 1.** Legacy CRL rows are inserted
   into `ca_crl_versions` before the store ever computes `next_crl_number()` in steady state, so
   `MAX(version)+1` naturally resumes above the highest backfilled version — tested explicitly
   (`migrate_from_sqlite — full happy-path backfill`: after backfilling a CRL at version 1,
   `next_crl_number()` returns 2, never 1).
2. **A version collision is always loud, never a silent clobber** — unchanged by this migration:
   `record_crl` is a plain `INSERT` (never `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`), so a duplicate version is
   refused, not overwritten. This was already true under SQLite; it remains true under Postgres.
3. **Cross-instance CRL numbering remains a tracked, NOT-newly-introduced limitation.** The
   pre-migration `ca_store.hpp` already documented this exact gap for a hypothetical HA/multi-
   instance/DB-restore scenario (#1240 UP-4) — true durable cross-instance numbering (an
   auto-retry-on-conflict republish loop spanning the CA-key-load-and-sign step) is explicitly
   OUT OF SCOPE for this migration, which ports the persistence layer, not a new HA feature nobody
   asked for here. `server.cpp`'s `publish_crl()` keeps its existing shape: `next_crl_number()`
   and `record_crl()` as two separate, short-lived leases with NO lease held across the CA-key-
   load-and-sign step in between (unchanged — the correct "never hold a lease across disk/signing
   work" shape, ADR-0012 §2) under its own process-local `crl_publish_mu_` member (unrelated to
   `CaStore::publish_next_crl`'s own, differently-scoped mutex — see below).

### `CaStore::publish_next_crl` — kept, zero production callers (verified)

Grep across the whole tree (`.cpp`/`.hpp`, excluding its own definition and test file) finds no
call site outside `ca_store.{hpp,cpp}` and `test_ca_store.cpp`. `server.cpp`'s actual production
CRL-publish path (`publish_crl()`) reimplements the same allocate→build→record shape manually,
under its OWN `crl_publish_mu_` member, calling `next_crl_number()`/`list_revoked()`/`record_crl()`
directly rather than through this method's `CrlBuilder`-callback abstraction. Kept for API/test
parity (it is unit-tested and may be a future convenience surface); internally hardened to abort
(return `nullopt`, consume nothing) on a `next_crl_number()`/`list_revoked()` read failure rather
than silently building a CRL over a wrong number or a possibly-incomplete revoked set — the same
fix class as the production path's own hardening above, applied so the untested-in-production
method does not carry a latent version of the identical bug.

### Backfill (ADR-0009)

**Mandatory, three-table, fingerprint-verified** — extends `LicenseStore`'s (ADR-0048) two-table
canonicalization design to three: `ca_root`, `ca_issued`, `ca_crl_versions`. All three are created
together, atomically, by the pre-migration SQLite `CaStore`'s v1 migration — no version of the
shipped binary can produce a legacy file holding some-but-not-all of the three, so that shape
fails the whole backfill closed (the same corrupt/hand-edited-file bias as an unrecognised enum
value).

- **`ca_root` (0-or-1 row, singleton):** ALL-IDENTITY, per the kickoff's explicit classification —
  any mismatch against an already-established row fails the backfill closed. The insert uses the
  SAME `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`-then-readback-and-compare shape as `try_insert_root()`, so it
  is race-safe against a concurrent `try_insert_root()` caller or a concurrent sibling backfill by
  construction (whichever INSERT lands first wins; everyone else reads back that row).
- **`ca_issued`:** IDENTITY (`subject`, `san`, `purpose`, `not_after`, `issued_at`, `issued_by`,
  `enrollment_request_id`, `cert_pem`, `issuer_fingerprint`, `issuer_key_id` — write-once at
  `record_issued()`, no other method mutates them) vs LIFECYCLE (`status`, `revocation_reason`,
  `revoked_at` — mutated only by `revoke()`). Direction resolved by a `cert_status_rank`
  (`active`=0 < `revoked`=1 terminal < unrecognised=2, rejected before ever reaching Postgres):
  Postgres strictly ahead (already revoked; the legacy snapshot predates it) is a benign
  WARNING-logged no-op, keeping Postgres's revoked state; **legacy strictly ahead, or both
  revoked but disagreeing on `revocation_reason`/`revoked_at`, fails the boot closed** — the
  kickoff's explicit instruction, verbatim: *"revoked-in-legacy/active-in-PG fails closed, never
  un-revoke."*
- **`ca_crl_versions`:** `version` is the natural conflict key. Byte-identical `der` at the same
  version is a benign no-op (the same CRL, backfilled twice); a DIFFERENT `der` under the SAME
  version is an RFC 5280 crlNumber fork and fails the boot closed — never silently pick a side.
- Every legacy `status` value is validated against the known enum set BEFORE it can reach
  Postgres (mirrors `LicenseStore`'s precedent for the identical class of exposure).
- Legacy files are read READ-ONLY and never deleted/moved — retained for the ADR-0009
  one-release rollback window.

### Observability

Three counters cover this store's failure/security-relevant surfaces, all boot-pre-seeded to 0 so
`increase(...) > 0` catches even the first occurrence rather than the series being entirely
absent from `/metrics` until it first fires: `yuzu_server_ca_crl_publish_failures_total`,
`yuzu_server_ca_reissue_blocked_total{reason="revoked_identity"}` (a revoked identity attempting
to re-provision — the control working as intended, not a failure, but worth an operator's
attention), and `yuzu_server_ca_revocation_sweep_read_failures_total`. A dedicated `yuzu-pki`
Prometheus alert group (`docs/prometheus/yuzu-alerts.yml`) covers all three
(`YuzuCaCrlPublishFailing`, `YuzuCaRevocationSweepReadFailing`, `YuzuCaReissueBlocked`). The
bootstrap advisory lock's connection-pool floor (effectively 2 even at the smallest deployment
size — the outer critical-section lease and its own nested per-call leases share one pool) is
documented in `server-admin.md`'s "Connection-pool sizing" section.

### `/readyz` / `/healthz`

Unchanged wiring — `has_root()` (now the fail-soft convenience, not the B-2 gate) already feeds
the existing `/readyz` `ca_root` signal (`server.cpp`); `is_open()` already joins the standard
store conjunction. No new wiring needed; the existing signal now correctly reflects a genuine
Postgres read failure as "unhealthy" rather than the pre-migration file-open check.

### Upgrade-test coverage — known gap, not unique to this store

`scripts/test/test-upgrade-stack.sh` carries exactly one store-specific data-survival assertion
(the original ADR-0009 generic-inventory pilot, `git log` shows no other touch to this file or
`test-fixtures-verify.sh`). None of the sibling Wave 2/3 migrations that followed it — LicenseStore
(ADR-0048), DeploymentStore, SoftwareDeploymentStore (ADR-0051) — added their own dedicated
previous-release-SQLite → new-release-Postgres assertion either; each relies on the harness's
generic `fixtures-verify` pass (asserts overall server health/migration success post-upgrade, not
per-store content). This migration follows that same precedent rather than being the first to
diverge from it: CA issued-cert + CRL history backfill is exercised by `test_ca_store.cpp`'s
dedicated `migrate_from_sqlite` suite (real legacy-schema fixtures, fingerprint verification,
idempotent-rerun) but not by the end-to-end upgrade harness. Closing this gap — for CaStore and
its siblings alike — is tracked as a follow-up on `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md`, not solved
here.

## Considered and rejected

- **Folding `has_root()` entirely into `get_root()` and updating every call site to the typed
  form.** Rejected as unnecessary churn: the two remaining `has_root()` callers (a background
  sweep tick, `/readyz`) are demonstrably safe with a degraded-collapses-to-false read, and
  forcing them onto the richer type would add call-site verbosity with no behavioral benefit.
  Keeping `has_root()` as a documented, narrow convenience — with an explicit doc-comment warning
  against using it for a security-relevant gate — was judged clearer than either extreme
  (blanket-typed everywhere, or blanket-bool everywhere). That doc-comment warning existed from
  this migration's first commit; it just did not stop the author from missing one of its own
  call sites (see "Adversarial review" below) — a warning comment narrows the class of mistake, it
  does not substitute for checking every call site against it.
- **Solving cross-instance CRL numbering (auto-retry-on-conflict) as part of this migration.**
  Rejected as scope creep beyond "migrate the persistence layer" — it is a pre-existing, already-
  tracked (#1240 UP-4) limitation this migration does not worsen (a collision was always refused
  loudly, never silently), and building the retry loop correctly requires re-running the CA-key-
  load-and-sign step, which crosses into `server.cpp`'s signing orchestration, not this store.
- **A single shared `kCaDuplicateSerialPrefix`/`kCaDbErrorPrefix` reused from another store's
  constants.** Rejected per the established Wave 2/3 precedent (ADR-0048's "Considered and
  rejected"): each store's error-prefix constants stay local so a future rename of one cannot
  silently affect another.

## Review History

This is a compact provenance record — what ran, what it found, what happened to it. Current
design truth lives in `## Decision` above, not here. Full structured findings (trigger/impact/
exposure/epistemic-status per this repo's derivation scheme, plus provenance and disposition) are
in the committed ledger: `governance.d/ca-store-postgres-migration.Hq3Wpm.jsonl` (45 findings
across 10 review passes). Resource-ownership detail for the bootstrap-lock/first-boot-key custody
chain — a policy-floor artifact independent of this history, not process narrative — lives in its
own durable file: `docs/resource-ledgers/default-certs-bootstrap-lock.md`.

| 1 | Adversarial review | Kimi K2.7 + Codex GPT-5.5 (external, independent, each compiling + running the real suite) | 1 HIGH fixed, 1 MEDIUM fixed, 1 LOW deferred (pre-existing) | Both models independently found the boot-time `has_root()`/`get_root()` regression before cross-examining each other — the strongest class of finding this process produces |
| 2 | Gate 3 (domain-triggered) | architect, cpp-expert, cpp-safety, quality-engineer | 1 HIGH fixed, 2 SHOULD fixed, 3 deferred (bounded) | The unscoped inventory-purge race — a distinct first-boot defect the adversarial round didn't cover |
| 3 | Gate 4 | happy-path, unhappy-path, consistency-auditor | 2 HIGH fixed, 1 SHOULD documented, 1 NICE deferred | UP-1 (sweep fail-closed-amplification, a false compliance record) and UP-2 (a crash-recovery gap the Gate 3 fix itself widened — superseded by pass 4 below) |
| 4 | Gate 8, round 1 | security-guardian + unhappy-path | 2 HIGH fixed, 1 NICE fixed | Both reviewers independently found UP-2's own self-heal fix had a concurrency gap — a static ownership proof, not a claim/CAS |
| 5 | Gate 8, cpp-safety domain re-review | cpp-safety | 1 SHOULD documented, 2 NICE fixed | The bootstrap lock's own pool-size floor |
| 6 | Gate 8, narrow closure re-verify | security-guardian + unhappy-path (independent re-reads of current code, not the diff) | 1 NICE fixed | Confirmed pass 4's findings CLOSED — the standing rule that only the reporting domain signs off its own finding |
| 7 | Gate 5/6 | chaos-injector, compliance-officer, sre, enterprise-readiness, docs-writer, architect | 1 HIGH fixed, 1 MEDIUM documented, 3 SHOULD fixed, 4 SHOULD deferred, 4 NICE (mixed) | C5-1: a fencing-token gap in pass 4's own lock fix — the lock-holding *connection* could die without the *process* dying |
| 8 | cpp-safety + security-guardian re-review of the C5-1 fix | cpp-safety, security-guardian | 2 policy floors fixed, 1 NICE deferred (pre-existing) | A `const_cast`-then-write UB (cpp-safety's enumerated floor) and a missing Resource Ledger |
| 9 | cpp-expert gap-fill | cpp-expert | 3 NICE fixed | First review of the fix-round commits specifically — routed-concerns' trigger is unconditional on any C++ change, and this coverage cell had been empty |
| 10 | cpp-safety + security-guardian re-review of the UP-3 fix | cpp-safety, security-guardian | 1 SHOULD fixed, 1 policy floor fixed, 1 MEDIUM documented | The ADR restructuring in this same round had deleted the committed Resource Ledger with no durable replacement — a policy floor, caught before push |

**Notable process findings, not product findings.** Three separate instances of an overclaiming
pattern were caught and retracted **before** being used as sign-off evidence, never after —
compliance-officer explicitly evaluated this as evidence of a sound review process, not a red
flag: (1) a regression test cited as red/green closure evidence for pass 4's finding turned out
not to reliably reproduce the pre-fix corruption (verified via 60 runs against the pre-fix commit
in a throwaway worktree; closure was reframed onto the lock's by-construction ordering proof
instead); (2) an operator-facing log line claimed "this instance provably minted it" after the
nearby comment had already been corrected away from that exact claim; (3) this ADR's own Gate 8
finding text asserted `upgrading.md`'s HA note "describes [multi-replica HA] as supported," when
this ADR's own Decision section states plainly that topology is not officially supported today.

**Post-governance follow-up (operator-directed, after the formal run above).** Two items deferred
by sre's Gate 6 pass (CA metrics alert rules, the bootstrap lock's pool-size floor in the capacity
doc) were fixed rather than filed as separate issues — see "Observability" above.

**UP-3 (self-heal without a restart) and a pre-existing defect it surfaced.**
Consistency-auditor's Gate 4 pass deferred UP-3 as a larger, separately-scoped change; built here
on operator request. A losing racer now polls the shared cert directory for the winner's complete
set for up to 15s before falling back to the original refuse-and-restart behavior (see "Self-heal
and the bootstrap advisory lock" above). Building it surfaced an independent, pre-existing defect
that UP-3 didn't cause but made newly likely to matter: every first-boot candidate wrote its CA
private key speculatively to the shared well-known `default-ca.key` path *before* racing
`try_insert_root`'s CAS, so on a shared cert directory with multiple simultaneous candidates,
whichever candidate's write landed last silently detached the established root from its real
private key — regardless of which candidate actually won the CAS — permanently defeating every
future self-heal attempt for that root. Verified empirically, not just reasoned: a 6-racer test
against one shared `TempDir` reproduced this on 7 of 8 runs before the fix (log evidence: a
"cert_matches_key mismatch" warning followed by the B-2 refusal, for a racer that should have
self-healed) and 0 of 15 runs after it. Fixed: the CA key is now written to disk only after a
candidate is confirmed the CAS's sole winner, at which point no other candidate can still be
racing for that name — `key_ref` itself is computed beforehand (a pure path calculation, no I/O)
so it can still be recorded in the same `try_insert_root` call.

**Pass 10 — cpp-safety + security-guardian domain re-review of this fix (2026-08-21).**
cpp-safety: PASSES, no BLOCKING findings; one SHOULD fixed (the poll loop's adoption decision
didn't cross-check the fingerprint of what it just validated against the root it lost the race
to — an unstated invariant true by construction today, now asserted explicitly rather than
assumed). security-guardian: one BLOCKING policy-floor finding, fixed — the ADR restructuring in
this same round had deleted the two committed Resource Ledger tables for the bootstrap-lock chain
with no durable replacement (the governance findings ledger has a different schema and cannot
substitute for one); moved to `docs/resource-ledgers/default-certs-bootstrap-lock.md` instead,
extended with this pass's own new resource (the deferred `default-ca` key write). One MEDIUM,
non-blocking, documented not fixed: deferring the key write past the CAS opens a narrow window
where a *sibling* process's unrelated, pre-existing self-heal check can see no local key yet and
refuse immediately rather than waiting — availability-only, fail-closed, and extending that
unrelated check's own poll would delay a genuine lost-key refusal by up to 15s on every
established install, a worse trade than the rare sibling-refusal it would prevent. Full findings:
`governance.d/ca-store-postgres-migration.Hq3Wpm.jsonl` pass 10.

**Self-caught, not a review finding: the new UP-3 test was itself scheduling-dependent.** A
subsequent full 10-shard suite run (higher system contention than an isolated run) hit a
legitimate, non-buggy scheduling outcome the test's log-evidence assertions weren't tolerant of —
all six racers' `get_root()` checks landed after the winner had already committed, so all six
correctly took the pre-existing UP-2 path and none exercised this fix's own new branch, failing
the test's `REQUIRE(logs.find("lost the first-boot CA-root race")...)`. Not weakened (a soft
check would trade "sometimes red for a good reason" for "always green regardless of whether it
verifies anything," which this branch's own review discipline treats as worse than an occasional
red); instead wrapped in a bounded retry of the whole scenario (fresh directory and store each
attempt, up to 5 attempts), mirroring `test_mcp_stream_bridge.cpp`'s `#3357` "quiesce before the
experiment" shape — exceeding the bound is still a hard `REQUIRE` failure, never a silent pass or
an infinite spin.

## Consequences

- Every CA read/write now surfaces a genuine database error to its REST/MCP/dashboard caller as a
  503/`kInternalError`/error-panel instead of a silently-empty/-false SQLite-mutex-guarded result,
  EXCEPT `is_revoked()`, which deliberately keeps its bool/fail-closed-to-`true` shape by design
  (see above) — this is a live behavioral change for every already-wired CA surface, unlike
  `LicenseStore`'s dormant-store precedent.
- The first-boot CA-root race is now handled correctly for the first time — under SQLite it was
  structurally impossible (each instance had its own file), so there was never a "correct"
  behavior to preserve; this migration is establishing new, tested behavior, not porting existing
  behavior.
- `CaStore` moves from "SQLite, single-connection-mutex-serialized" to "Postgres, pool-concurrent"
  — matches every other migrated store's concurrency model.
- The legacy `ca.db` is retained for one release (ADR-0009 rollback window), then removed per the
  standard cadence.
- `#1276`'s flake lead is narrowed (see "Write-path failure classification" above) but not closed
  — a genuine production serial collision remains believed-negligible given random 128-bit
  serials, and this migration adds the typed-retry infrastructure without asserting the flake's
  root cause is fully diagnosed.
