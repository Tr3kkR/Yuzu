# 0058 — `InstructionStore` Postgres migration (authoritative, fresh-start-by-default, no
legacy-SQLite backfill; first every-boot reseed loop on the ladder)

## Context

`InstructionStore` (`server/core/src/instruction_store.{hpp,cpp}`) persists the content-plane
catalog `docs/Instruction-Engine.md` describes: `InstructionDefinition -> InstructionSet ->
ProductPack` (`ProductPackStore`, ADR-0054, is the layer above; it references only
`ProductPackStore::verify_signature`, a static/storage-independent method — no store-to-store
coupling). Two tables, no FK between them (`instruction_set_id` is a soft TEXT reference;
`delete_set` explicitly unsets it on referencing definitions rather than relying on a cascade).
It is a Wave 2 store on `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md`. Previously SQLite
(`instructions.db`), guarded by a `shared_mutex`.

**Security-shaped invariant preserved unchanged**: `import_definition_json` enforces an Ed25519
signature gate (#1073/W7.4) with five documented rejection modes; `import_definition_json_trusted`
bypasses it ONLY for build-time-baked content, with no REST/MCP/network surface reaching it. Both
paths stay byte-identical in behaviour; the gate itself is pure/storage-independent
(`ProductPackStore::verify_signature`) and unaffected by this migration.

**The genuinely new problem this store introduces to the ladder**: every other migrated
content-catalog store either (a) has no boot-time reseed loop at all (`ProductPackStore`:
packs are purely operator-installed), or (b) has a reseed loop but rows that are write-once after
insert (`RbacStore`'s built-in role/permission defaults). `InstructionStore` has **both** an
unconditional every-boot reseed loop (`server.cpp:4703-4859` walks build-time-embedded
`kBundledDefinitions`/`kBundledSets`, calling `import_definition_json_trusted`/`create_set` for
each entry on **every** boot) **and** rows that mutate after insert (`update_definition` — no
analogous `update_set` exists). That combination is what this ADR's Decision section works
through: a straight port of the reseed loop's current SQLite behaviour, taken literally, contains
a defect (documented and pinned below).

### Pinned current-SQLite behaviour (the contract to preserve, or deliberately diverge from)

Four Catch2 tests (`tests/unit/server/test_instruction_store.cpp`, tag `[instruction_store][seed]`,
commits `bb8b334ac`/`1f518fe4c` on this branch) empirically pinned the pre-migration SQLite
store's boot-reseed contract before any porting began, per this migration's kickoff instructions.
`import_definition_json_trusted`'s pre-INSERT existence check is keyed ONLY on `id` — content is
never compared:

1. Untouched bundled definition: reseed = conflict-skip (no-op).
2. Operator-edited bundled definition: reseed does NOT clobber the edit (still skip, because
   `id` exists).
3. Operator-**deleted** bundled definition: reseed **RESURRECTS** it — a deleted `id` is
   indistinguishable from a never-seeded `id`, so the next boot's replay re-inserts the original
   bundled content.
4. A later release shipping **changed** bundled content for an existing `id` — untouched or
   operator-edited — still just conflict-skips; the row is frozen at first-seed vintage forever.
   Confirmed (read of the full `server.cpp:4703-4859` boot-content block) that no other path
   writes into `InstructionStore` at boot — no packs loop, no `ProductPackStore`-mediated upsert.

Finding 4 makes finding 3 load-bearing rather than cosmetic: **delete-then-reboot is currently
the only way an existing bundled id ever picks up newer bundled content.** The kickoff doc that
scoped this migration states, in one place, "an operator-modified or operator-deleted definition
must NOT be clobbered or resurrected by a later replica boot or a release upgrade re-seed," and a
few lines later, "the existing behaviour is the contract, whatever it is" — those two lines
conflict specifically on the delete case.

### Independent-model consult (Codex/Sol) + primary-source verification

Before locking in a direction, Codex (`gpt-5.6-sol`, opine mode, read-only) reviewed the fork and
recommended **against** preserving resurrection-on-delete, citing `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`
by name. That citation was verified against the actual file rather than trusted at face value
(claim-discipline): playbook lines 286-329 name this **exact** failure mode — hard DELETE +
unconditional reseed silently reversing an operator revocation on ordinary restart — as a
documented anti-pattern, with `RbacStore::remove_permission` (#2703) as the reference case. That
reference case is real, shipped code, not aspirational doc narrative: `rbac_store.cpp` has
`kRevokeCoordLockSql` (line ~93) and table `revoked_seed_defaults` (line ~430), used at three
separate writer call sites. RbacStore's own three-round history (bare DELETE -> resurrection bug;
explicit `deny` row -> wrong, not read-neutral, vetoed unrelated grants; dedicated suppression
table consulted only by the reseed helper -> shipped) plus a fourth bug found on top (the
check-then-insert-against-the-bookkeeping-table race, needing a `pg_advisory_xact_lock` taken as
its own statement strictly before the check-and-mutate) is the exact shape this store's seed
design reuses. Dave's decision, made with this evidence in hand: **do not port
resurrection-on-delete forward** — deletion becomes an intentional suppression that survives
future reseeds.

## Decision

### Schema

`instruction_store`, per ADR-0008's `snake_case(FullClassName)` rule.

```sql
CREATE TABLE instruction_definitions (
  id                      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name                    TEXT NOT NULL,
  version                 TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '1.0',
  type                    TEXT NOT NULL,
  plugin                  TEXT NOT NULL,
  action                  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  description             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  enabled                 BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  instruction_set_id      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  gather_ttl_seconds      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 300,
  response_ttl_days       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 90,
  created_by              TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  created_at              BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  updated_at              BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  yaml_source             TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  parameter_schema        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  result_schema           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  approval_mode           TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'auto',
  concurrency_mode        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'per-device',
  platforms               TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  min_agent_version       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  required_plugins        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  readable_payload        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  visualization_spec      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  response_templates_spec TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]');
CREATE TABLE instruction_sets (
  id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name        TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  created_by  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  created_at  BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0);
-- ADR-0009 erasure consistency / reseed suppression (the headline decision — see below).
CREATE TABLE deleted_seed_content (
  kind       TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'definition' | 'set'
  id         TEXT NOT NULL,
  deleted_at BIGINT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (kind, id));
```

The pre-migration SQLite constructor's ~9 `legacy_alters[]` compat `ALTER TABLE` statements plus
its v2/v3 `MigrationRunner` steps (`visualization_spec`, `response_templates_spec`) are all folded
into this single v1 — the Postgres schema is born fresh, matching every other migrated store's
"no ALTER-wart machinery on PG" precedent (`ProductPackStore`'s `verified` column,
`docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`'s worked recipe). No index beyond the two primary keys — the
pre-migration SQLite store had none either (not even on `instruction_set_id`, despite
`delete_set`'s `UPDATE ... WHERE instruction_set_id=?` full-table-scan); adding one is a
straightforward follow-up, out of scope for a faithful port.

**`open_with_migrations` does not exist.** The playbook (line 92) and ADR-0008/ADR-0012 name a
thin construction helper by that name as mandatory; it is not implemented anywhere in the tree —
verified by grep. Every existing store, including the playbook's own worked reference
(`offline_endpoint_store.cpp`) and the most recently merged content-catalog store
(`product_pack_store.cpp`), hand-rolls the acquire/`PgMigrationRunner::run`/smoke-read sequence
directly; `plugin_config_store.cpp:145-158` documents this exact discrepancy in its own
constructor comment. This store follows the same hand-rolled, actually-shipped precedent rather
than a helper that would not compile.

### Secrets (ADR-0010)

None. Verified against `docs/Instruction-Engine.md`/`docs/yaml-dsl-spec.md`: neither defines a
secret-typed/credential-bearing YAML field, matching `ProductPackStore`'s identical
self-assessment for its structurally similar `yaml_source` column. `yaml_source`/`parameter_schema`
are not flagged anywhere in the codebase as secret-bearing; ADR-0010's queued secret-bearing list
(webhooks, offload-targets, runtime-config) does not name this store.

### Posture

AUTHORITATIVE / fail-hard (ADR-0012 §1), both construction and runtime — explicitly required by
this migration's kickoff doc: "a silent-empty definition read breaks dispatch (`execute_instruction`
resolves definitions here); degrade must error, never empty-resolve." `create_definition`,
`update_definition`, `import_definition_json`, `import_definition_json_trusted`, `create_set`
already returned `std::expected` pre-migration and keep that shape. Widened to `std::expected`
here (ADR-0036 typed-read policy, matching `ProductPackStore`'s `list`/`get` widening):

- `query_definitions` -> `std::expected<std::vector<InstructionDefinition>, std::string>`
- `get_definition` -> `std::expected<std::optional<InstructionDefinition>, std::string>`
  (matches `ProductPackStore::get`'s exact shape)
- `list_sets` -> `std::expected<std::vector<InstructionSet>, std::string>`
- `delete_definition` -> `std::expected<void, std::string>`, `"not_found: "`-prefixed on a
  missing id (mirrors `ProductPackStore::uninstall`)
- `delete_set` -> `std::expected<void, std::string>`, same `"not_found: "` convention
- `export_definition_json` -> `std::expected<std::string, std::string>` (widened for
  consistency with every other read on this store rather than left as the one silent-`"{}"`
  exception; its only callers are a REST export handler and a dashboard preview — no
  authorization/targeting decision reads it, so this is a lower-stakes widening than the others,
  recorded here rather than left to infer)

`kInstructionStoreDbErrorPrefix` classifies genuine DB/lease failures (503); `"not_found: "`
classifies missing-id (404); caller-input validation errors stay unprefixed (400) — mirrors
`ProductPackStore::kProductPackDbErrorPrefix`'s three-way split.

### Seed-vs-live semantics (the headline decision)

Definitions and sets stay **conflict-skip on id existence for every already-live row** — findings
1/2/4 above are preserved exactly: no content comparison, an operator's edit is never clobbered,
and an untouched-but-stale bundled row does not auto-update on a release upgrade (that gap is
explicitly out of scope — see Consequences).

**Deletion becomes an intentional suppression, not a plain DELETE.** `deleted_seed_content(kind,
id)` is `RbacStore`'s `revoked_seed_defaults` shape extended with a `kind` discriminator (the same
technique `revoked_seed_defaults` itself uses via its `securable_type` column) rather than two
separate tables — one lock, one table, both content kinds. Consulted **only** by the trusted-reseed
insert path; never by any read path, any normal `create_definition`/`create_set` call, or any
authorization/targeting decision — the playbook's general rule ("don't represent 'suppress the
next reseed' as a fact your read path can see").

**Discriminator, reusing an existing signal.** `import_definition_json_impl`'s existing
`check_signature` parameter already identifies "boot-time trusted content" exactly:
`check_signature=false` is `import_definition_json_trusted`, whose own contract states "there is
no REST/MCP/network surface for this method by design" — i.e. `!check_signature` is already,
today, a sound proxy for "this call originates from the every-boot reseed loop, nowhere else." No
new flag is introduced for definitions; `import_definition_json_impl` routes to a new private
seed-aware insert path when `!check_signature`, and to the plain insert path (unchanged, no
tombstone consultation) when `check_signature` is true (operator signed-import).

Sets have no signature concept at all — `"trusted"` would misleadingly imply one. A **new** public
method, `create_set_seed(const InstructionSet&)`, is the seed-aware entry point
(`server.cpp`'s `kBundledSets` loop calls it instead of plain `create_set`); the existing
`create_set` stays exactly as it is today — no lock, no tombstone consultation, used by the
REST-facing "create a custom instruction set" route (`server.cpp:15408`) exactly as before.
Mirrors `import_definition_json`/`import_definition_json_trusted`'s "two named entry points make
the trust boundary explicit at every call site" pattern, extended by name to match what's actually
being distinguished here (reseed vs. operator-authored), not signature verification.

**Locking.** Every writer that touches BOTH `instruction_definitions`/`instruction_sets` AND
`deleted_seed_content` takes `kSeedCoordLockSql` — `SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock(2037545589,
hashtext('instruction_store:seed_coordination'))` (`2037545589` is the shared cross-store
namespace constant `rbac_store.cpp`/`product_pack_store.cpp` already use; the hashtext string is
this store's own key) — as the **first statement**, in an explicit transaction, strictly before
the statement that checks-and-mutates (embedding it via CTE in the same statement does not work —
a statement's READ COMMITTED snapshot is fixed before any of its own function calls run,
`docs/postgres-store-playbook.md` lines 309-329). Four writers take it: the trusted-reseed insert
path (checks the tombstone, then inserts), `create_set_seed` (same), `delete_definition` (deletes,
then stamps the tombstone), `delete_set` (unsets `instruction_set_id` on referencing definitions,
deletes, then stamps the tombstone) — all four in one transaction each. Plain `create_definition`,
`update_definition`, `create_set`, and the signed `import_definition_json` path never touch
`deleted_seed_content` and take **no** lock, matching `ProductPackStore::install`'s identical
lock-free shape (only `uninstall`/`migrate_from_sqlite` take `kErasureCoordLockSql` there).

A bundled `id` an operator has NOT deleted needs no lock for the insert's own correctness — a
plain `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING RETURNING id` is already correctly arbitrated by
Postgres's unique index across any number of racing replicas — but every writer in this class
takes the lock unconditionally anyway (rather than branching on "have I ever seen a tombstone")
for the same reason `RbacStore`/`ProductPackStore` do: coarse-grained, store-wide serialization
of operator-driven content-catalog management is cheap, this is never a hot path, and a
conditional lock would reintroduce exactly the check-then-act race the lock exists to prevent.
232 bundled definitions therefore serialize through one advisory-lock transaction each at boot —
boot-time only, not a steady-state cost, and not a new latency class this ladder hasn't already
accepted for `RbacStore`'s seed pass.

**Result classification.** `PGRES_COMMAND_OK` on `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` only proves the
statement executed, not that this writer's row won — every insert uses `RETURNING id` +
`PQntuples()`, never `PQcmdTuples()`/bare status (`docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`'s named
anti-pattern). A tombstoned id and an already-existing id both resolve to the same
`kConflictPrefix`-prefixed `unexpected()` from the seed-aware insert path — `server.cpp`'s boot
loop classification (`is_conflict_error` -> "skip, already accounted for") needs no change; it
cannot distinguish "already there" from "deliberately suppressed," and does not need to.

### Backfill — none (ADR-0009's fresh-start-by-default class)

Per ADR-0009's fresh-start-by-default amendment: this store does **not** implement
`migrate_from_sqlite()` and never reads the legacy `instructions.db`. No production fleet has
ever run a pre-Postgres build of any Yuzu store, so there is no real legacy data to protect —
the original "mandatory backfill" default assumed a real fleet that has never existed. Follows
`ResponseStore`'s (#2691) unconditional-skip precedent: no flag, no conditional path, just a
one-time boot log line (`"InstructionStore initialized (schema instruction_store) — fresh
start, no legacy backfill"`) noting the fresh start on cutover.

This is a scope change from an earlier revision of this ADR, which specified a mandatory,
extensively-designed backfill (three correction rounds, each fixing a real conflict-detection
bug the previous round introduced — see the governance ledger,
`governance.d/instructionstore-adr0058-gov.4uLptn.jsonl`, for the full history). That design is
retired in full along with this section: the `migrate_from_sqlite()` method, its legacy-table
readers and fingerprint helpers, its dedicated `[backfill]`-tagged regression tests, and the
`sqlite_backfill_source` marker table are all removed. The `deleted_seed_content` tombstone
mechanism documented above is UNAFFECTED — it protects against a different, unrelated hazard
(the every-boot bundled-content reseed loop resurrecting an operator's deletion), not against
losing pre-migration SQLite content.

### Testing

Three of the four instruction test files construct a store and move to `PostgresTestDb`/
`PgTestTemplate` (`docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`); `test_sensitive_instruction_params.cpp`
tests pure functions with no store construction and is untouched. The seed-vs-live pinning suite
(tag `[instruction_store][seed]`) is **not** ported unchanged — Dave's Option B decision means
test 3 ("trusted reseed RESURRECTS an operator-deleted bundled definition") must now assert the
OPPOSITE against the Postgres store (deletion survives reseed); this is the one deliberate,
ADR-recorded behaviour change this migration makes, not a silent test rewrite to chase green.

## Considered and rejected

- **Option A — preserve resurrection-on-delete exactly, per-definition `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  advisory-lock-guarded, no suppression table.** Rejected on Codex's independent read, verified
  against `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`'s named anti-pattern and `RbacStore`'s real shipped
  fix for the identical shape (see Context above). On a shared Postgres substrate the defect is
  materially worse than on per-instance SQLite: any sibling replica boot or rolling restart can
  undo another replica's operator-authored delete, not just that one process's own restart.
- **Hash-based auto-refresh of untouched-but-stale bundled content** (compare a recorded
  last-seeded-hash per id; update only when live content still matches it). A legitimate third
  design, but not a lightweight alternative to a tombstone — the states "never seeded" / "seeded,
  untouched" / "seeded, operator-modified" / "seeded, operator-deleted" still need persistent
  state surviving deletion, which is a tombstone/seed-provenance ledger by another name, plus
  further undesigned decisions (compare-and-swap against a concurrent operator edit, mixed-version
  replica behaviour, rollback/downgrade semantics, audit treatment of an automatic content
  change). Deferred to a follow-up ADR — this migration is a substrate port, not a new content
  lifecycle feature.
- **Two separate tombstone tables** (`deleted_seed_definitions`/`deleted_seed_sets`) instead of
  one `deleted_seed_content(kind, id)`. Rejected for no material benefit — `RbacStore`'s
  `revoked_seed_defaults` already establishes the single-table-plus-discriminator-column shape in
  this codebase; one lock and one table to reason about is simpler than two of each.
- **A LIFECYCLE rank/direction model for definitions, mirroring `DeviceTokenStore`'s `revoked`
  handling.** Rejected — nothing in `InstructionDefinition`'s mutable columns is a security
  control whose legacy-side truth must ever override a live Postgres value (unlike `revoked`,
  which gates authentication); "Postgres's existing value always wins on a LIFECYCLE conflict" is
  simpler and already matches the seed-vs-live rule the reseed loop itself enforces.

## Consequences

- `delete_definition`/`delete_set` gain a `"not_found: "` REST-visible contract (400 -> 404 on a
  missing id, mirroring `ProductPackStore::uninstall`'s identical change) — callers in
  `rest_api_v1.cpp`/`workflow_routes.cpp` must classify it.
- `query_definitions`/`get_definition`/`list_sets`/`export_definition_json` callers across
  `dashboard_routes.cpp`, `discover_routes.cpp`, `mcp_server.cpp`, `policy_evaluator.cpp`,
  `rest_api_v1.cpp`, `schedule_runner.cpp`, `workflow_routes.cpp` now handle a
  `std::expected` and must 503 on a genuine DB error rather than silently treating it as "no
  definitions" — the exact fail-open ADR-0036 exists to close, and the one this migration's
  kickoff called out by name for `execute_instruction`'s definition resolution.
  (`legacy_shim.cpp` only calls `create_definition`, already `std::expected` pre-migration — not
  an affected caller; corrected here after Gate 3 review flagged the original overclaim.)
- **Breaking, deliberate**: resurrection-on-delete of a bundled definition/set is REMOVED.
  Post-migration, an operator-deleted bundled id stays deleted across every future boot and
  release upgrade, on every replica, indefinitely — recorded in a changelog fragment as an
  intentional behaviour change, not a defect fix framed as invisible.
- The untouched-but-stale bundled-content refresh gap (finding 4) is NOT solved by this
  migration — an existing bundled row, touched or not, never picks up newer bundled content
  short of an operator deleting and losing the row (which the tombstone above no longer even
  allows to come back automatically). Tracked in #2555 (pre-existing issue covering the same
  underlying problem), not solved here.
- **Historical: multi-replica backfill correctness (now moot — the backfill mechanism this
  fixed is retired, see "Backfill" above).** An earlier revision of this store's design had a
  mandatory legacy-SQLite backfill that went through two rounds of real conflict-detection bugs
  (an original over-scoped IDENTITY comparison bricking every replica's boot on ordinary
  bundled-content vintage drift; the fix for that over-correcting in the opposite direction,
  losing protection against genuinely-different operator content sharing an id). Both fixed
  before merge; no release ever shipped either broken version. Full history:
  `governance.d/instructionstore-adr0058-gov.4uLptn.jsonl`.
- **A later fix round touched code outside the (now-retired) Backfill section and is recorded
  here rather than there:**
  - `schedule_runner.cpp`'s `fire()` no longer calls `advance_schedule` on an InstructionStore
    DB-error branch — a transient failure now retries the occurrence next tick instead of
    permanently losing it (independently found by both `security-guardian` and `sre` at Gate 3).
  - `policy_evaluator.cpp`'s `dispatch_due`/`evaluate_now` throttle-restore-on-store-unavailable
    is CAS-guarded (was an unconditional overwrite that could clobber a concurrent claim); a
    second gap where `evaluate_now` had no restore logic at all is closed; `verdict_for` now
    returns `"error"` on a genuine DB error instead of silently degrading to an empty schema.
  - Seven new `audit_log`/`audit_fn_` calls cover previously-unaudited denial paths:
    `instruction.create`/`.update`/`.delete` on `db_error`, `.delete` on `not_found`, and
    `policy.evaluate` on `store_unavailable` (`compliance_routes.cpp`).
  - `rest_api_v1.cpp`'s `persist_templates` and `workflow_routes.cpp`'s product-pack uninstall
    `instruction_store`-unavailable branch are reclassified from a bare `"not_found: "` to the
    `kInstructionStoreDbErrorPrefix`/`kProductPackDbErrorPrefix` convention (both now alias a
    shared `kDbErrorPrefix` in `store_errors.hpp`), so a genuine DB error 503s instead of 404ing.
- **This fix round's own diff was re-reviewed at Gate 8 and found two further gaps, both closed
  before merge:**
  - `PUT /api/instructions/{id}` fell through to a bare 400 for an unknown id (indistinguishable
    from a validation error) instead of the 404 every sibling route in this migration uses;
    fixed to classify `update_definition`'s `"not_found: "` prefix the same way `DELETE` does.
  - `policy_evaluator.cpp`'s throttle-restore CAS token was the claim timestamp itself — two
    claims on the same policy within the same wall-clock second are indistinguishable, so a
    concurrent claim's restore could in theory clobber a different claim. Replaced with a
    monotonic per-policy `generation` counter (`EvalClaim` in `policy_evaluator.hpp`), captured
    locally at claim time and compared instead of the timestamp.
- **Superseded post-merge, not by this ADR:** the `EvalClaim` generation-counter fix immediately
  above no longer exists. Merging `origin/dev` (PolicyStore's own PG migration, ADR-0056) pulled
  in a durable, fleet-wide `PolicyStore::claim_due_policies` dispatch claim that replaces the
  entire in-memory `last_eval_` throttle map this fix was patching — the ABA hazard is
  structurally absent from a durable atomic claim the way it never can be from a local timestamp
  comparison, so there was nothing to re-apply the fix onto. `dispatch_instruction`/
  `kickoff_check`'s `DispatchOutcome`/`DispatchResult` enum (this ADR's own addition, propagating
  a genuine InstructionStore DB error distinctly from a not-found id) was similarly retired in
  favor of ADR-0056's `std::expected`-based idiom already used throughout that file — the
  InstructionStore DB/lease-failure distinction itself is preserved (grafted onto
  `dispatch_instruction`'s new `std::expected<std::string, std::string>` return, propagated
  through `kickoff_check`/`evaluate_now`/`remediate` the same way those functions propagate their
  own other degrade paths), just no longer via a bespoke enum. See ADR-0056 for the durable-claim
  design and `governance.d/instructionstore-adr0058-gov.4uLptn.jsonl`'s superseding rows for the
  merge-time re-verify.
- No change to the #1073/W7.4 signed-import enforcement semantics, the Ed25519 verify path, or
  the `--allow-unsigned-definitions` operator flag — all pure/storage-independent, ported
  unchanged.
