# ADR-0030 — Held-open connections must not own a worker thread

## Context

The server's HTTP surface is cpp-httplib, which is **thread-per-connection**. A response
held open — any Server-Sent Events stream — occupies one worker thread for its entire life,
blocked in `cv.wait_for`. It is not doing work; it is *waiting*, and it is waiting while
holding a thread.

Four surfaces hold responses open today, all on the same shared pool:

| Surface | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /mcp/v1/` | token (principal-bound session) | the MCP Streamable HTTP channel (track 2f PR 2) |
| `GET /api/v1/events` | token (`Execution:Read`) | the agentic execution-event stream |
| `GET /sse/executions/{id}` | cookie | the dashboard executions drawer |
| `GET /events` | **none** | the legacy dashboard live-update stream |

**Provenance.** Every claim below about `StreamBudget`, the `GET /mcp/v1/` channel and the
admission arithmetic is stated **as of `feat/mcp-streamable-http-pr2` @ 3bac4647** — the branch
this ADR lives on. `stream_budget.hpp` and the MCP GET channel do not exist on `dev`, so a
reader checking these claims against a `dev` checkout will not find them; check them against
that branch.

Track 2f PR 2 added the first admission budget for these (`stream_budget.hpp`), and in doing
so did the arithmetic nobody had done before. The result is the reason this ADR exists:

- httplib's default pool is `max(8, cores−1)` base, growing to 4× that. On an ordinary
  8-core host that is **32 threads**.
- Holding back a plain-REST reserve (8) and allowing for the one draining provider a stream
  can leave behind during a takeover (×2), the affordable number of concurrent streams is
  **12**.
- The only number the codebase records is **"hundreds of agentic clients per server"**
  (`server/core/src/event_bus.hpp:73`, quoted again at `stream_budget.hpp:51` on the PR-2 branch) — and it is
  worth being precise about what that is: an **assumption inside a queue-cap rationale**, not
  a sizing requirement. **No stream-count requirement exists.** Establishing one is a
  deliverable of this ADR.

**The transport can serve 12. The only figure anyone has written down is hundreds.** The cap is not a
safety feature; it is the visible edge of a self-inflicted scarcity. Rationing it more
carefully — capping the other three surfaces so they cannot starve each other — makes the
accounting honest but leaves the ceiling exactly where it is.

A second fact, surfaced by the same arithmetic: `GET /events` performs **no authentication**
and enqueues without a cap. An unauthenticated caller can therefore pin worker threads and
grow an unbounded per-connection queue. That is a pre-auth denial-of-service on today's
`dev`, independent of anything in track 2f, and it is filed separately — but it is the
sharpest illustration of why "a held-open connection costs a thread" is the wrong primitive
to build a fleet-scale platform on.

**Who should hold these connections was never asked.** Track 2f's design record mentions the
Erlang gateway exactly twice, both times to *rule it out as a risk* ("the Erlang gateway has
no `/mcp` routing — verified"; "Gateway unaffected"). The question asked was "does this break
the gateway?" The question never asked was "should the C++ server be **holding** these
connections at all?" That omission is the substance of this ADR. The answer it records
(Decision 4) is **the presentation binary** — not the gateway, which stays southbound.

## Decision

**1. One admission budget across every held-open response, as a guard rail — not a ration.**
The invariant worth stating is: *held-open connections can never starve plain
request/response traffic.* That cannot be stated truthfully with per-surface silos, so every
surface that holds a response open takes a lease from the same counter
(`yuzu::server::detail::StreamBudget`). This is Decision 15(h) of the ADR-1005 execution
plan, and it is correct.

The single counter guarantees held-open streams cannot starve plain REST, but a single counter with a
single reserve does **not** guarantee fairness *among* stream callers - one principal can hold every
lease outside the reserve. A **per-principal lease cap** on the authenticated surfaces (`GET /mcp/v1/`,
`/api/v1/events`, the dashboard drawer), keyed by authenticated credential or session, is required
before the agentic surface is production-enabled. This is a **distinct** policy from ADR-0032's
per-principal run/grant caps: a held-open stream lease is a different resource from a run admission or
a delegation artifact, so it is sized and keyed on its own. The unauthenticated legacy `/events`
stream cannot be principal-keyed at all; it needs a **separate pre-auth limit** (and its missing
authentication is the pre-auth DoS filed separately below).

**2. Derive the worker pool from the intended stream count — not the cap from the accidental
pool.** This inverts the arrow. A thread blocked in `cv.wait_for` burns **zero CPU** — the only
periodic cost is one wakeup per heartbeat interval per stream — and its resident cost is a
fraction of the thread's **stack reservation — which is virtual, and differs per platform**
(8 MB on Linux/glibc, 1 MB on Windows, 512 KB for macOS secondary threads; quoting "8 MB" as
*the* stack size is itself a way to divide by the wrong constant). What the **resident**
fraction actually is on our platforms is **not yet measured, and this ADR does not estimate
it**: a **measured per-held-stream RSS baseline (Linux glibc, MSVC, macOS) is required before
anyone sizes `--max-sse-streams` or a worker pool off it.** Sizing a fleet-scale resource off
an unmeasured constant is how the 12-stream ceiling happened in the first place. The shape of
the rule stands regardless of the number:

```
workers = kMaxProvidersPerStream × target_streams + plain_rest_reserve
```

The operator declares the streams they intend to serve; the pool is sized to honour it. The
budget then binds only under abuse or genuine over-subscription, which is what a cap is for.

**3. Expose utilisation, not per-surface counters.** The number an operator needs is
*held-open responses ÷ pool capacity* — it is the signal that says "raise the target", and no
per-surface gauge can express it.

**4. Record the ceiling, and name the durable fix.** (2) raises the ceiling from 12 to
whatever the **measured** per-held-stream cost supports — **a figure this ADR deliberately
does not guess**, because guessing it here would be the same mistake (2) exists to correct,
two decisions later. Wherever that ceiling lands, thread memory and scheduler pressure
eventually bind, and beyond it the answer is not a bigger pool — it is to **stop owning a
thread per stream**. The durable fix is **an asynchronous presentation
binary**:

- **Hold the connections in presentation, on an async C++ runtime (Drogon).** ADR-0031 splits
  presentation into its own binary, which makes its runtime a free choice; Drogon's
  non-blocking event loop and coroutines remove the thread-per-held-stream cost **in-language**
  — the C++ stays C++, with no re-home into another runtime — and N stateless presentation
  replicas can sit behind the one MCP origin. Core's HTTP runtime can remain as it is, behind
  short-lived bounded calls. **This avoids a *language* port, not a *framework* port:** every
  handler registration, the HTMX renderers and `mcp_server.cpp` move from httplib's synchronous
  handler signature to Drogon's async/coroutine model, and **every SSE content-provider is
  rewritten against a different concurrency model** — which is precisely the code this ADR is
  about. It is the largest item in ADR-0031's migration and it needs its own estimate; "it
  ports across" is true of the language and false of the effort. This is ballot A3 (amended),
  and it is **conditional on the G10 build canary** — which gates the **linkage, not the
  port**: Drogon is a heavyweight new dependency landing on the most fragile part of the build
  (Windows MSVC static linking, the #375 history), so it faces a vcpkg-port canary across the
  full matrix before it is ratified.
  Durable session identity and the replay ring belong **behind the presentation boundary, not in
  presentation** — presentation owns live sockets, not the truth. **Whether** they become durable, and
  where they live, is **G6/G7 and remains OPEN** (ADR-0031's terms index says so; this ADR does not
  get to settle it in passing). Note what is already binding: exec-plan Decision 15(d) holds 2f's MCP
  sessions **in memory**, with a bounded **non-durable** replay ring and **no new store** — so naming
  Postgres here would have licensed a durable session store that no ballot approved and that track 2f
  is explicitly forbidden from building.
- **Not the Erlang gateway.** The BEAM would win the same ceiling, but it would mean re-homing
  the MCP framing and the HTMX renderers into a second language. The gateway stays what it is:
  the **southbound** fleet edge, unchanged by this ADR.
- **Not a reverse proxy.** An SSE proxy (nginx/envoy) holds one upstream connection per client,
  so the C++ pool still pins a thread per stream — and buffering proxies break SSE outright.
  The connection-holder must speak MCP itself.

**Constraint that shapes the choice:** the MCP spec requires POST and GET on the **same
endpoint** (`/mcp/v1/`). Streaming therefore cannot be moved to a side port or a separate
component on its own — it moves with the **whole** MCP surface, and that surface is
presentation. This is why the durable fix is a property of the presentation binary rather
than a box inserted in front of the server.

## Consequences

- Track 2f PR 2 implements (1), (2) and (3). The MCP stream cap stops being a capacity limit
  (12) and becomes an anti-abuse backstop against a pool sized for the declared workload.
- The dashboard and `/api/v1/events` are bounded for the first time — closing a starvation
  path that exists on `dev` today, before MCP streaming ships at all.
- (4) is **not** built here. It rides ADR-0031's decomposition (presentation as its own
  binary) and the G10 Drogon build canary; it needs its own governance and a migration that
  strands no existing deployment. The Erlang gateway's role does not change.
- Until (4) lands, the honest statement to an operator is: *streams are cheap but not free;
  size `--max-sse-streams` for your fleet **off a measured baseline, not an estimate**, watch
  utilisation, and know the ceiling is thread-count.*

## Alternatives considered

- **Cap the sibling surfaces and stop there** (the original #2056 shape). Makes the
  accounting truthful and the guarantee real, but leaves the ceiling at 12 on a default box.
  Rejected as insufficient on its own; adopted as one half of the answer, alongside (2).
- **Raise the pool without a shared budget.** Removes the immediate pain and leaves no
  guarantee at all: with no counter across surfaces, nothing prevents held-open connections
  from consuming the whole pool. Rejected — a bigger unbounded resource is still unbounded.
- **Long-poll instead of SSE.** Would avoid holding a thread indefinitely, but the MCP spec
  mandates the SSE channel with `Last-Event-ID` resume, and long-poll re-introduces the gap
  semantics the replay ring exists to eliminate. Rejected.
- **Move only the dashboard's streams off the pool.** Halves the problem and leaves the
  agentic surface — the one the platform's scale target is actually about — on the ceiling.
  Rejected.
