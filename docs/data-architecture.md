# Data Architecture for Analytics Integration

The `architect` and `sre` agents load this document when designing schemas for new features. CLAUDE.md keeps a one-line pointer.

When building new features, design data schemas with downstream analytics in mind. The four data classes below are the integration surface; all other persistence is internal.

## Response data

- Every instruction definition declares a typed schema (column name + type).
- Permitted types: `bool`, `int32`, `int64`, `string`, `datetime`, `guid`, `clob`.
- Typed schemas make it trivial to materialize ClickHouse tables or Splunk sourcetypes from a `ProductPack`.
- Large text fields use `clob` with configurable truncation — never embed unbounded blobs in `string` columns.

## Audit events

- Envelope: `{timestamp, principal, action, target_type, target_id, result, detail}` — see `docs/observability-conventions.md` for the full schema.
- Forwardable to Splunk HEC or generic webhook sinks.
- Indexed by `timestamp` and `principal` for efficient queries.
- Denied operations MUST emit an audit event (SOC 2 CC7.2 evidence chain).

## Metrics

- Prometheus exposition format on `/metrics`.
- Labels: `agent_id`, `plugin`, `method`, `status`, `os`, `arch`.
- Grafana dashboard templates: `docs/grafana/`.
- ClickHouse ingest path: `prometheus_remote_write`, or scrape `/metrics` directly.

## Inventory data

- Per-plugin structured blobs stored server-side.
- Queryable via REST API with filter expressions.
- **Schema is self-describing** — the plugin reports its own schema at registration. Downstream tooling consumes the schema to materialize tables, not by hard-coding column lists.
