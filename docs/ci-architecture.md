# CI architecture — runner topology, vcpkg cache, persistence

Reference for Yuzu's three-tier CI architecture (April 2026 overhaul).
CLAUDE.md keeps the headline tier breakdown + runner topology; this document
holds the cache-key contract, persistence rules, and operational knobs that
the `build-ci` agent loads on workflow / vcpkg / scripts/ci changes.

Plan of record: `/home/dornbrn/.claude/plans/our-ci-has-been-piped-castle.md`.
Failure-mode runbook: `docs/ci-troubleshooting.md`.

## Tier summary (mirrors CLAUDE.md)

- **Tier 1 — PR fast-path** (`ci.yml` on `pull_request`): one Linux variant
  (gcc-15 debug on the `yuzu-bigtam-linux` pool), one Windows variant (MSVC debug on
  the `yuzu-weetam-windows` pool), one macOS variant (appleclang debug on GHA-hosted
  `macos-15`), plus `proto-compat`. Wall target: <10 min per leg.
- **Tier 2 — push to dev/main** (`ci.yml` on push): full 4-way Linux matrix
  (gcc-15 / clang-21 × debug / release), 2-way Windows, 2-way macOS. **No
  sanitizers, no coverage** — those moved out (#410).
- **Tier 3 — nightly cron** (`nightly.yml`, `0 6 * * *` UTC +
  `workflow_dispatch`): ASan+UBSan, TSan, coverage on the Big Tam pool
  (`yuzu-bigtam-linux`, gated on `bigtam_pool_healthy`), plus a Windows ASan
  leg (`windows-asan`, agent-only, Wee Tam pool, gated on
  `windows_pool_healthy`) covering the Windows-only spark mechanisms that the
  Linux sanitizers can't reach (#1934a). On any leg failure, the `alert` job auto-opens or comments on a
  `nightly-broken` issue. **Discipline norm: no merge to main while a
  `nightly-broken` issue is open.**

  The TSan leg preloads `/tmp/libgai_sync_shim.so` (built inline from a
  ~30-line C file at job start) to replace glibc's `getaddrinfo_a()` async
  DNS path with synchronous `getaddrinfo()` on the calling thread. Required
  because cpp-httplib enables `CPPHTTPLIB_USE_NON_BLOCKING_GETADDRINFO=ON`
  by default (vcpkg port), which makes glibc spawn an async-DNS helper
  thread via `clone3` directly — bypassing TSan's `pthread_create`
  interceptor — so the helper's per-thread allocator state is never
  initialised and the first `malloc()` from it segfaults inside
  `__tsan::SizeClassAllocator64LocalCache::Allocate (this=0x8)` (#438).
  Scoped to the TSan job via step-level `env: LD_PRELOAD`; production
  keeps the non-blocking-DNS behaviour. The same shim is mirrored into
  `sanitizer-tests.yml` so `/test --full` benefits identically.

  On Test failure, the TSan job's `Capture stack trace under gdb`
  diagnostic re-runs `yuzu_server_tests` under `gdb -batch` with the
  Catch2 seed replayed, dumps `thread apply all bt full` + `info
  registers`, and rides the existing `meson-testlog-tsan` artifact.

`workflow_dispatch` only works once a workflow file exists on the **default
branch (`main`)**. Cron schedules likewise. New workflows added on `dev` are
dormant until merged.

## Self-hosted runner topology

| Runner | Host | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `yuzu-bigtam-linux-{0..3}` | Big Tam Threadripper 9970X, native Ubuntu **26.04** (gcc-15/clang-21) | **all self-hosted Linux** (shared label `yuzu-bigtam-linux`): ci.yml `linux` matrix, `proto-compat`, sanitizer-tests (asan/tsan), nightly (asan/tsan/coverage), codeql Linux leg, **release.yml** (build-linux, build-gateway, docker-publish\*), cache-prune-linux. 4 runners on one host. |
| `yuzu-weetam-windows-{0..3}` | Wee Tam 9970X native Windows 11 — 4 CCD-pinned runners, shared label `yuzu-weetam-windows` | **all self-hosted Windows**: ci.yml `windows`, nightly `windows-asan`, codeql Windows leg, release `build-windows`, instructions-windows-validate, cache-prune-windows. Provisioned from [`deploy/windows/`](../deploy/windows/README.md). |
| `macos-15` | GitHub-hosted | macos matrix |

**Retired 2026-06-21:** `yuzu-wsl2-linux` (Shulgi WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04, label
`yuzu-shulgi`) and `yuzu-local-windows` (Shulgi native Windows) — superseded by
Big Tam and Wee Tam. Remove them from `.github/runner-inventory.json` to silence
the inventory sentinel. `proto-compat` and `cache-prune-linux` use the bare
`[self-hosted, Linux, X64]` label (no compiler), so they resolve to Big Tam.

### Ubuntu 26.04 migration (Big Tam) — COMPLETE

Big Tam is a native **Ubuntu 26.04 (Resolute)** box, default toolchain **GCC 15 /
Clang 21** (vs Shulgi's 24.04 GCC 13 / Clang 19). **Every self-hosted Linux job
runs on Big Tam**: ci.yml `linux` (#1609), then sanitizer-tests / nightly / codeql
Linux, then release.yml + the remaining Windows→Wee Tam stragglers (#1615). The
supporting scaffolding:

- Native files `meson/native/linux-gcc15.ini` + `linux-clang21.ini` are the live
  toolchain files (they also set `-fuse-ld=mold`; see Build speed below). The
  24.04 `linux-gcc13.ini`/`linux-clang19.ini` stay only for the GHA-hosted
  ubuntu-24.04 canary.
- The CI runner image (`Dockerfile.ci-linux`), the local `Dockerfile.ci`, and the
  four sanitizer images (`Dockerfile.{server,agent}-{asan,tsan}`) are on
  `ubuntu:26.04` + gcc-15/clang-21. `gcc-13`/`clang-19` stay installable from the
  archive but are not the defaults.
- `pre-release.yml`'s `install-deb` smoke matrix has an `ubuntu:26.04` leg.

`ImageOS` stays `ubuntu24` on every leg (setup-beam has no `ubuntu26` prebuilt
OTP; the 24.04 OTP runs fine on 26.04 — same `libcrypto.so.3` soname). Big Tam
runs 4 runners on one host, so every apt step is `flock`-serialized on
`/tmp/yuzu-ci-apt.lock`, the shared CI Postgres container is flock-serialized too
(`scripts/ci/ensure-postgres.sh`), and meson is installed per-job via
`pip --user` (it is not a host default). Full history + per-file detail:
**`docs/ci-ubuntu-2604-cutover.md`**.

### Build speed (Big Tam)

The `runner` user (shared `HOME=/home/runner` across r0–r3) is provisioned once
for fast, download-free builds:

- **ccache** `max_size=50G`, compression on — the host default is 5 GiB, far too
  small for ~700 TUs × variants. ci.yml/nightly cap at 30G via the
  `CCACHE_MAXSIZE` env; release.yml now sets `CCACHE_MAXSIZE=30G` too (it had been
  inheriting the host default).
- **mold** linker (`apt install mold`), wired via `-fuse-ld=mold` in the gcc-15 /
  clang-21 native files — large cut in link time on the big `yuzu-server` /
  `yuzu-agent` binaries and the release LTO link.
- **meson** 1.11.1 + the rest of `requirements-ci.txt` persist in the runner
  user's `~/.local`, so the per-job `pip install --user --require-hashes` is a
  no-op (no re-download).
- **rpm** (rpmbuild) installed for release.yml's packaging step — absent on a
  fresh 26.04 (it was the first-Big-Tam-release blocker). Note: Big Tam ships RPM
  **6.0** vs Shulgi's 4.x — watch the first release.

The Windows toolchain is codified in [`deploy/windows/`](../deploy/windows/README.md)
(the native-Windows analog of `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.ci-linux`): a versioned
provisioning spec, a manifest, and a runner self-test. All four runners share one
vcpkg binary cache via `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE=D:\ci\tool_cache` (mirroring
`CCACHE_DIR`), so the CCD split doesn't fragment the cache 4×.

Inventory declared in `.github/runner-inventory.json`. The sentinel at
`runner-inventory-sentinel.yml` (every 30 min) compares actual to expected
and opens a `runner-inventory-drift` issue on mismatch. Both the sentinel
and the new ci.yml `preflight` job share `scripts/ci/runner-health-check.py`
(`--mode sentinel` vs `--mode preflight`). Preflight gates downstream
self-hosted jobs with explicit
`if: needs.preflight.outputs.<runner>_healthy == 'true'` — fail-closed: a
degraded runner skips its jobs in <30 s rather than queueing 30 min into a
stalled runner. Requires the `RUNNER_INVENTORY_TOKEN` PAT secret
(fine-grained, Administration:read on Tr3kkR/Yuzu); without it preflight
returns false and self-hosted jobs are skipped with a clear reason.

As of #1978, preflight also emits a `code_changed` output (from
`scripts/ci/detect-code-change.sh`); the build jobs additionally gate on
`&& code_changed == 'true'`, so a docs-only PR skips the whole matrix. The
matrix-expanded required contexts (`Linux gcc-15 debug`, `Windows MSVC debug`,
`macOS debug`) would otherwise stay "Expected" forever on a docs-only PR
(a top-level-skipped matrix job emits none of its inner check names), so a
`docs-required-checks` stub emits those exact names as success when
`code_changed == 'false'`. `ci.yml` no longer path-filters `pull_request`;
the `push:` trigger keeps its docs `paths-ignore`.

## Postgres for server tests (`YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`)

ADR-0006 decision 8: every tier that runs server tests gets a real
PostgreSQL and exports `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`. The shipped substrate is
**PostgreSQL 18** (`deploy/docker/Dockerfile.postgres`), and the Linux/docker
+ GHA-macOS legs test against it; the server SQL is version-agnostic (13+), so
a runner-native cluster on an older major still exercises the suites
correctly. One script implements it everywhere —
`scripts/ci/ensure-postgres.sh`, inserted as an `Ensure Postgres (server
tests)` step between Build and Test in ci.yml (linux / windows / macos) and
nightly.yml (asan / tsan / coverage).
Resolution order inside the script:

1. **Pre-set `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`** (runner-level env) — the escape
   hatch for any bespoke runner setup. On a **multi-agent box** (runner
   name ending `-<n>`, i.e. the 4-runner pools) the pre-set DSN names the
   *agent-0* cluster and agent `<n>` uses **port + `<n>`** when that
   per-agent cluster answers a probe — one instance per agent, so
   concurrent jobs never share a WAL/buffer pool (#2094, the 2026-07-12
   Wee Tam server-suite timeouts). Until a box is provisioned with the
   extra clusters the script falls back to the shared pre-set DSN with a
   `::warning` — no flag day. Runners without a `-<n>` suffix use the DSN
   as-is.
2. **Docker** (self-hosted Linux) — idempotent persistent container
   (`docker start` || `docker run --restart unless-stopped`, image pinned
   to the same digest as `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.postgres`'s base;
   one-time cost per runner). On the multi-agent `yuzu-bigtam-linux` pool
   each agent gets **its own container** — `yuzu-ci-postgres-<n>` on
   `127.0.0.1:15440+<n>`, `max_connections=400` (#2094/#2096),
   self-created on the agent's first job. Single-agent boxes keep the
   shared `yuzu-ci-postgres` on `127.0.0.1:15432`. The 15440+ base and
   15432 avoid colliding with native clusters (5432), the dev pg-canary
   (5433), and the UAT sidecar (15433). Lifecycle is `flock`-serialized
   per container name.
3. **brew** (GHA-hosted macOS, no docker) — `postgresql@18` bottle +
   throwaway trust-auth cluster under `$RUNNER_TEMP` on
   `127.0.0.1:15432`.
4. **Native cluster on `127.0.0.1:5432`** — the generic self-hosted
   Windows precondition: a PostgreSQL 16+ Windows service with role
   `yuzu` / password `yuzu` / database `yuzu_test`, bootstrapped
   **once** per runner (installer or `choco install postgresql16`, then
   `createuser`/`createdb` as above). When `psql` is on PATH the script
   authenticates the conventional DSN with `SELECT 1` before exporting
   it — a TCP listener with the wrong credentials produces a `::warning`
   and no DSN rather than a false "ready". Without `psql` it falls back
   to the bare TCP probe with a loud unverified-credential warning.
   Prefer the runner-level env override (path 1) if the box already runs
   Postgres with different credentials.

   **Wee Tam (`yuzu-weetam-windows`) uses path 1, not path 4:** each runner
   provides native PostgreSQL **18** services — agent 0's winget-installed
   `postgresql-x64-18-yuzu-ci` on `:5433` plus one initdb'd cluster per
   further agent (`postgresql-x64-18-yuzu-ci-<n>` on `:5433+<n>`, #2094) —
   and a machine-level `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` (the agent-0 DSN; path 1
   derives the per-agent port) that wins before the docker probe, so the
   leg stays deterministic regardless of any Docker engine state.
   Provisioning specifics live in
   [`deploy/windows/`](../deploy/windows/README.md). (The retired
   `yuzu-local-windows` box ran a PG 16 binaries-zip service on 5433 — see
   git history if that bootstrap pattern is ever needed again.)
5. Nothing found → `::error`, exit 1.

**Fatal on every non-success path since #1320 PR 1 (`SOFT_EXIT=1`):**
the pg substrate suites (`[pg]`-tagged cases in the server suite)
consume the DSN and skip cleanly when it is unset — so a runner without
a database would silently skip that coverage. `exit "$SOFT_EXIT"`
(= exit 1) is reached on every failure path: Docker container not ready
in 60 s (path 2), brew cluster not ready (path 3), native-cluster
credential failure when `psql` is available (path 4), and nothing found
(path 5). The one non-fatal exception is path 4 without `psql`: a TCP
probe alone produces a `::warning` and still exports the conventional
DSN (credential **unverified** — wrong credentials then surface as
downstream `[pg]` test failures; install `psql` on the runner's PATH,
e.g. `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin` on the `yuzu-weetam-windows` runners, to
get the authenticated gate instead). Locally the tests still skip when
`YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` is unset; when it is set but unreachable they
fail rather than skip.

Local-dev note: to run the non-pg server tests on a machine with no
Docker and no Postgres, invoke the test binary directly
(`tests-build-server-*/yuzu_server_tests`) with `YUZU_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`
unset — the `[pg]` cases skip cleanly. The `/test` skill and CI
deliberately hard-fail at the ensure-postgres step instead (that is the
gate working, not a skill bug).

Operational notes for shared instances: on a box where a Postgres
instance IS still shared across concurrent jobs (single-agent boxes, or
a multi-agent box before its per-agent instances are provisioned —
the fallback `::warning`), the migration runner's advisory locks are
**cluster-wide**, so same-named stores in different ephemeral test
databases briefly serialize on each other (transaction-scoped locks:
never deadlock, never cross-database corruption). The 4-agent pools run
**one instance per agent** (#2094) precisely so no job shares WAL/fsync
bandwidth — or advisory-lock space — with a concurrent job. After the
Big Tam cutover the legacy shared `yuzu-ci-postgres` container on
`:15432` is unused there and can be `docker rm -f`'d.

**Test-database lifecycle (PR #2091).** Ephemeral per-case databases
(`yuzu_test_<epoch>_<salt>_<n>`, created/dropped by `PostgresTestDb`)
coexist with per-process **template** databases
(`yuzu_test_tpl_<epoch>_<salt>_<key>`, built once by `PgTestTemplate` and
dropped at `testRunEnded`) — during a run, each of a box's 4 runner agents
legitimately holds up to ~a dozen template databases. A pile-up is NOT
automatically "teardown is failing": names embed their creation epoch, and
every suite start sweeps names older than 6 h (`kTestDbStaleAfterSeconds`),
so leaks from killed runs self-heal within that window; the sweep prints a
`sweep saw N ... dropped M` summary in the job log. A weekly out-of-band
janitor complements it (#1367): `cache-prune.yml` (Sundays 04:00 UTC +
`workflow_dispatch`) runs `scripts/ci/sweep-test-databases.sh` on both
self-hosted boxes, so leaks reclaim even on a box that stops running `[pg]`
legs. Epoch-named databases age by the same >6 h/server-clock rule; names
the epoch sweeper can never parse (pre-epoch format `yuzu_test_<salt>_<n>`,
implausible clock stamps) are dropped only when the datdir's `PG_VERSION`
mtime exceeds 7 days AND the database has zero active backends
(superuser-only via `pg_stat_file`; dropped without FORCE so a racing
connection vetoes). Hand-cleaning a wedged instance: only ever touch
`yuzu_test_*`/`yuzu_test_tpl_*` names; prefer "name-epoch older than 6 h"
over "no current connections" (a live fixture is momentarily
connection-free between drop and re-create); pre-epoch-format names are
reclaimed by the weekly cron after 7 days — hand-clean only if one must go
sooner. The server suite's meson timeout was recalibrated 600 s → 900 s in
the same PR, then split into `[pg]`/`~[pg]` shards at 600 s each (#2092;
see the comment above the two `test('server ...', ...)` entries in
`tests/meson.build`).

## Universal vcpkg cache-key contract

`scripts/ci/vcpkg-triplet-sentinel.sh` is the single source of truth for
"have the inputs to vcpkg actually changed?". Key:

```
sha256(vcpkg.json + vcpkg-configuration.json + triplets/<triplet>.cmake + $VCPKG_COMMIT)
```

Stored at `vcpkg_installed/.<triplet>-cachekey.sha256`. On drift, wipes
`vcpkg_installed/<triplet>/` AND `vcpkg_installed/vcpkg/` (the
per-workspace registry — `info/`, `status`, `updates/`. Leaving the
registry behind after wiping the triplet tree leaves orphaned
`info/<port>_<triplet>.list` entries that make the next `vcpkg install`
short-circuit to "already installed" and then fail post-install
pkgconfig validation; this was #741.) Never touches `$WS/vcpkg/` (the
sibling vcpkg tool root, owned by lukka/run-vcpkg), never
`runner.tool_cache`, never ccache. Persistence: self-hosted in
`${runner.tool_cache}/yuzu-vcpkg-binary-cache-{linux,asan,windows}`
(per-triplet, outside workspace). macOS uses `actions/cache@v5` keyed on
the same invariant.

The script must run cleanly under MSYS2 bash on Windows. **Do NOT use
`set -e` + `[[ test ]] && cmd` short-circuits** — they silently exit under
MSYS2 (cost us run #25051196135). Use `if/fi` blocks and explicit
per-command error checks.

## Persistence and recovery

Self-hosted checkouts use `clean: false`. Pre-checkout wipes `build-<os>/`
ONLY on branch change; vcpkg state is invalidated by the sentinel above.
`meson setup --reconfigure` when `meson-info/` exists. Manual recovery:
`bash scripts/ci/runner-reset.sh`
(`git clean -fdx -e vcpkg/ -e vcpkg_installed/ -e build-*/`) — **the only
sanctioned in-repo nuke path**; never `rm -rf` runner caches (memory
`feedback_vcpkg_cache.md`).

## Per-OS build directory names

Matrix: `build-{linux,windows,macos}`. Nightly variants:
`build-linux-{asan,tsan,coverage}`. `sanitizer-tests.yml` + `release.yml` +
`pre-release.yml` follow the same convention so the warm asan binary cache
is shared. Closes #406.

## Flaky-test retry (`flake-retry`)

`scripts/ci/flake-retry.py` wraps the `meson test` step on `ci.yml`'s three
test legs (PR fast-path + push matrix; **not** nightly/sanitizer, which stay
fail-loud so a real ASan/TSan race is never masked). Every run — green
included — first gets the #2093 duration watchdog: a per-suite
duration/budget table in the step summary, plus a `::warning` for any suite
past 80% of its meson timeout (reporting only; pass/fail semantics never
change). On a clean run it does nothing further. On failure it isolates the
failed **Catch2 case(s)** — it re-runs the
failed suite binary (located via `meson introspect --tests`) with Catch2's own
junit reporter, since meson's junit is only suite-level — then:

- any failed case **not** in `tests/known-flaky.json` (scoped to this OS) →
  the job **fails** (real regressions stay blocking);
- a failed suite that can't be classified per-case (non-Catch2, e.g. the
  gateway eunit/ct legs, or a crash/timeout with no junit) → **fails** (never
  mask);
- a **listed** case is retried in isolation up to 2× (`--retries`); the job
  passes only if it recovers, and a listed case that fails every retry still
  **fails** (a regression *inside* a flaky test is caught too).

`tests/known-flaky.json` is the static, in-repo, PR-curated source of truth —
one entry per case with `platforms` (OS-scoped; `["all"]` = cross-platform and
**must** carry an `issue`), `reason`, and `added`. Cross-platform flakes emit a
loud `::warning` (they signal a genuinely nondeterministic test, not an env
quirk); OS-scoped ones a `::notice`. Entries older than 90 days get a soft
`::warning` nag (never a hard fail). The wrapper validates the list up front and
fails fast on a malformed one.

No DB: visibility is the job summary + annotations; a per-case trend store is
deferred to a future `ci-ingest`-style step (the junit artifacts are the raw
data source). This is reversible test tooling — no ADR (rationale in the wrapper
header).

## Workflow-PR canary

`ci.yml`'s `detect-ci-changes` + `canary` jobs run only when a PR touches
`.github/workflows/`, `.github/actions/`, or `scripts/ci/`. Canary mirrors
the linux build on a fresh-disk GHA-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` with
`actions/cache` for vcpkg — catches workflow regressions before main.

## Cache pruning + weekly maintenance

`cache-prune.yml` runs weekly (Sun 04:00 UTC) on each self-hosted runner.
Deletes `${RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE}/yuzu-vcpkg-binary-cache-*/<file>` >30 days
old. Does not touch ccache (own LRU at `CCACHE_MAXSIZE=30G`).
Also sweeps the buildx local cache the chisel images write
(`/mnt/d/docker-buildcache/*-chisel`, `mode=max` — several GB/arch, no
built-in eviction); whole-`*-chisel`-dir mtime sweep >30 days, Linux only.
Since #1367 the same run also executes `scripts/ci/sweep-test-databases.sh`
on both boxes — the weekly out-of-band janitor for leaked `yuzu_test_*`
databases (thresholds and semantics: "Test-database lifecycle" above).

## Chiselled demo images + agent bundle (release-time)

`docker-publish-chisel` (in `release.yml`) builds the server/gateway/agent
`*.chisel` images multi-arch — linux/amd64 native + linux/arm64 via **QEMU**
— on the self-hosted Linux runner. The emulated arm64 vcpkg-from-source
compile can hold that single runner slot up to its 360-min timeout, so the
job carries a `cancel-in-progress: true` concurrency group (a re-tagged
release supersedes a stale build instead of queueing behind it). It is
**not** in the `release` job's `needs:`, so a slow/failed demo-image build
never blocks the actual release. The sustainable fix for the QEMU cost is a
native arm64 runner — the open decision tracked in `docs/demo-environment.md`
("Publishing").

`docker-publish-agent-bundle` runs **after** `release` (it repackages the
release's own signed agent archives) on a GitHub-hosted runner — no
compilation, so no self-hosted dependency — and cosign-signs + SBOMs +
attests the pushed `yuzu-agent-bundle-chisel` image like the other publish
jobs.

## vcpkg state corruption — recovery path

If a Windows CI run repeatedly fails at `Install vcpkg packages` with a
missing `.pc` file under `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows/lib/pkgconfig/`, the
corruption is in `vcpkg/packages/` (which the cache-key sentinel does NOT
reach). Recovery procedure + full corruption-path inventory:
`docs/ci-troubleshooting.md` §7. Don't leave the recovery step in `ci.yml`
after an incident — it defeats the cache.
