# TLS Policy

This page describes the TLS version floor and cipher allow-list Yuzu pins
across its listeners, and precisely what's proven by CI versus what's
disclosed as a known gap. See [Server Administration](server-admin.md#tls-configuration)
for how to configure the underlying certificates.

## What's pinned

Every listener below negotiates **TLS 1.2 or higher** and, when TLS 1.2 is
negotiated, is restricted to this six-suite allow-list (all ECDHE, so every
negotiated session has forward secrecy; both ECDSA and RSA families so
operator-supplied RSA certificates keep working):

```
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
```

| Surface | Pinned by | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| Agent gRPC listener (`:50051`) | `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES` (process env, pinned before any gRPC call) | `test_grpc_tls_policy.cpp` — real loopback handshakes |
| Management gRPC listener (`:50052`) | Same env pin (shared gRPC process state) | Same suite (same credential builder) |
| Gateway-command client (server → gateway mTLS) | Same env pin | `test_grpc_tls_policy.cpp` — outbound cases against a raw TLS server |
| HTTPS dashboard listener (`:8443`) | `SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list` applied directly to httplib's `tls_context()` right after listener construction | Manual `openssl s_client` probe (see below) — **not** a handshake unit test in this PR |
| Certificate hot-reload validation context | Same cipher list applied to the reload's temporary validation `SSL_CTX` | `test_cert_reloader.cpp`'s live-`SSLServer` reload case (validates the cipher list survives a hot-swap) |

**Agent side is NOT pinned by this change.** `agents/core`'s own gRPC client
credentials still negotiate whatever gRPC's library default offers
(AEAD-only suites, TLS 1.2 floor) until the follow-up PR (#4722 Part B) pins
`agents/core` the same way.

## Why a process environment variable

gRPC's C++ credentials API (`grpc::SslServerCredentialsOptions`,
`grpc::SslCredentialsOptions`, and the experimental
`TlsCredentialsOptions`) has no cipher or ciphersuite setter. The only lever
gRPC exposes is the `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES` environment variable, read once
by `grpc_core::ConfigVars` on first use and applied internally via
`SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list`. Ordering therefore matters: the server pins this
variable before constructing anything that could touch gRPC, and unconditionally
overwrites whatever the process inherited — an operator- or
container-supplied value for `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES` is never honoured.

## TLS 1.3 is not pinned by this mechanism

`SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list` (and therefore `GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES`) only
governs TLS 1.2 and earlier cipher *suites*. TLS 1.3 ciphersuite selection
uses a separate OpenSSL API (`SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites`) that gRPC's
credentials layer never calls on any code path, so a TLS 1.3 handshake
always negotiates whichever of OpenSSL's own default suites
(`TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` / `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` /
`TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`) both sides offer. The server's startup log
says this explicitly rather than implying TLS 1.3 is covered.

## Startup log lines

On every start, once the version banner has printed, the server logs:

```
TLS policy: TLS 1.2 cipher list pinned for gRPC and HTTPS: ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
TLS policy: TLS 1.3 suites are OpenSSL's own default (...) — gRPC never calls SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites on any credentials API, so TLS 1.3 suite selection is not pinned
```

If the allow-list resolves to zero usable TLS 1.2 ciphers against the
OpenSSL build actually linked (a boot self-check, distinct from the log
lines above), the server logs a `critical` message and refuses to start
rather than silently serving with no effective policy.

## What CI asserts

`tests/unit/server/test_grpc_tls_policy.cpp` drives the production
credential builders (`yuzu::server::detail::build_server_tls_credentials`,
`build_mtls_client_credentials`) over real loopback TLS/mTLS handshakes.
Every negative case asserts genuine refusal by the peer — either a received
TLS alert, or (where this OpenSSL/gRPC build closes the connection instead
of emitting an alert record) `SSL_R_UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING` following
a successful TCP connect — never a probe that merely failed locally:

- **TLS 1.0 only** and **TLS 1.1 only** — refused independently.
- **Non-allow-listed but leaf-compatible ciphers** — refused, with a
  same-shape positive control on an allow-listed cipher.
- **Certless client** against a listener requiring one — refused, with a
  positive control presenting the trusted client leaf.
- **Plaintext client** against the TLS listener — refused, with a positive
  control proving the probe recognises a real plaintext HTTP/2 server.
- **Wrong-CA client certificate** (inbound) — refused, both via the raw
  probe and via the production gRPC client credentials landing in
  `TRANSIENT_FAILURE`.
- **Wrong-CA gateway impersonator** (outbound) — the production client
  credentials refuse a server presenting a leaf from an untrusted CA.
- **Outbound cipher enforcement** — the production client credentials,
  forced to TLS 1.2, negotiate a pinned-only suite (proving the env pin
  governs the client direction too) and refuse a server offering only a
  non-allow-listed cipher.

`tests/unit/test_tls_policy.cpp` (agent suite; pure, no network) pins the
allow-list's exact text and ordering, both ECDSA and RSA families being
present, and `resolve_cipher_policy`'s refusal on an unresolvable list.

`tests/unit/server/test_cert_reloader.cpp` proves the cipher pin survives a
live certificate hot-swap on a real `httplib::SSLServer`.

**The HTTPS listener's pin itself has no automated handshake test in this
PR** — its fail-closed branch (`SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list` failing on an
already-valid `SSL_CTX`) is impossible in practice with a fixed compile-time
literal. Evidence for the HTTPS pin is the manual `openssl s_client` probe
below, plus the reload test's live-context assertion.

## Manual verification

```bash
# TLS 1.1 refused on the agent listener
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:50051 -tls1_1

# A non-allow-listed cipher refused on TLS 1.2
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:50051 -tls1_2 -cipher ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256

# An allow-listed suite outside gRPC's OWN default negotiates (proves the pin)
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:50051 -tls1_2 -cipher ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305

# Same non-allow-listed-cipher refusal on the HTTPS dashboard listener
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:8443 -tls1_2 -cipher ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256

# Confirms the production entrypoint's unconditional overwrite and ordering:
# an inherited GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES must NOT survive.
GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES=ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 ./yuzu-server ...
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:50051 -tls1_2 -cipher ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
# still negotiates -> the server's own pin overwrote the inherited value.
```

## Known follow-up

The production-entrypoint ordering (the pin running before gRPC's first
use in the real `yuzu-server` binary, as opposed to the test executable's
own independent static-initialiser pin) is verified manually above, not by
an automated test — the unit test executable pins from its own static
initialiser and cannot observe `main.cpp`'s ordering. An automated
assertion is tracked as a follow-up issue against the `scripts/integration-test.sh`
TLS mode (roadmap PR 1).

Part B of this work pins `agents/core`'s own gRPC client the same way and
reuses `tests/unit/tls_probe.hpp` unchanged.
