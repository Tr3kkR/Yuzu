# Timeline Activity Record (TAR)

The TAR plugin continuously captures system state snapshots and records changes as timestamped events in a local SQLite database on each endpoint. It enables retrospective investigation of "what happened on this machine" without requiring pre-configured logging or SIEM integration.

## What TAR captures

TAR monitors four categories of system activity:

| Category | Collection interval | Events detected |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Processes** | 60 seconds (fast) | Process started, process stopped |
| **Network connections** | 60 seconds (fast) | Connection opened, connection closed |
| **Services** | 300 seconds (slow) | Service started, stopped, state changed |
| **User sessions** | 300 seconds (slow) | User login, user logout |

Each collection cycle takes a snapshot of the current state, compares it to the previous snapshot, and records only the differences as events. This keeps the database compact while providing full visibility into system changes.

## Querying TAR data

### From the Yuzu dashboard

Use the **TAR Query** instruction to search events by time range and type.

### From the REST API

```
POST /api/v1/instructions/execute
{
  "plugin": "tar",
  "action": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "from": "1711000000",
    "to": "1711100000",
    "type": "process",
    "limit": "500"
  }
}
```

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `from` | No | 0 | Start of time range (Unix epoch seconds) |
| `to` | No | now | End of time range (Unix epoch seconds) |
| `type` | No | all | Filter: `process`, `network`, `service`, or `user` |
| `limit` | No | 1000 | Maximum results (max 10000) |

### Output format

Each event is output as a pipe-delimited line:

```
timestamp|event_type|event_action|snapshot_id|detail_json
```

Example:

```
1711050123|process|started|1711050123001|{"pid":1234,"ppid":1,"name":"nginx","cmdline":"nginx -g daemon off;","user":"www-data"}
1711050123|network|connected|1711050123001|{"proto":"tcp","local_addr":"0.0.0.0","local_port":80,"remote_addr":"10.0.0.5","remote_port":54321,"state":"ESTABLISHED","pid":1234}
1711050423|service|state_changed|1711050423002|{"name":"sshd","display_name":"OpenSSH","status":"stopped","prev_status":"running","startup_type":"automatic","prev_startup_type":"automatic"}
1711050423|user|login|1711050423002|{"user":"admin","domain":"CORP","logon_type":"remote","session_id":"pts/0"}
```

### JSON export

Use the `export` action for JSON output suitable for integration with Splunk, ClickHouse, or ELK:

```
POST /api/v1/instructions/execute
{
  "plugin": "tar",
  "action": "export",
  "parameters": { "type": "process", "limit": "100" }
}
```

## Configuration

Use the `configure` action to adjust TAR behavior.

| Setting | Valid range | Default | Description |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `retention_days` | 1-365 | 7 | Days to keep events before automatic purge |
| `fast_interval` | 10-3600 | 60 | Seconds between process/network collections |
| `slow_interval` | 30-7200 | 300 | Seconds between service/user collections |
| `redaction_patterns` | JSON array | See below | Patterns for command-line redaction (case-insensitive) |

**Validation rules:**

- When both `fast_interval` and `slow_interval` are provided, `fast_interval` must be less than `slow_interval`.
- `redaction_patterns` must be a JSON array of non-empty strings.

Example:

```
POST /api/v1/instructions/execute
{
  "plugin": "tar",
  "action": "configure",
  "parameters": {
    "retention_days": "14",
    "fast_interval": "30"
  }
}
```

## Security: command-line redaction

TAR automatically redacts sensitive command-line arguments before storing process events. Any command line matching a redaction pattern has its `cmdline` field replaced with `[REDACTED by TAR]`.

Default redaction patterns:

```json
["*password*", "*secret*", "*token*", "*api_key*", "*credential*"]
```

Patterns use case-insensitive substring matching. The `*` characters at the start and end indicate substring semantics (e.g., `*password*` matches any command line containing "password" in any case).

To customize:

```
POST /api/v1/instructions/execute
{
  "plugin": "tar",
  "action": "configure",
  "parameters": {
    "redaction_patterns": "[\"*password*\",\"*secret*\",\"*token*\",\"*private_key*\"]"
  }
}
```

## Checking TAR status

The `status` action returns database health information:

```
record_count|15234
oldest_timestamp|1710950000
newest_timestamp|1711050423
db_size_bytes|2097152
retention_days|7
```

## Forcing an immediate snapshot

The `snapshot` action triggers an immediate full collection of all four categories, useful before a maintenance window or at the start of an investigation:

```
POST /api/v1/instructions/execute
{
  "plugin": "tar",
  "action": "snapshot"
}
```

## Performance impact

TAR is designed for minimal performance overhead:

- **Fast collection** (processes + network): typically completes in under 100ms
- **Slow collection** (services + users): typically completes in under 200ms
- **Database size**: varies by system activity; a typical endpoint generates 1-5 MB per day
- **CPU**: negligible between collection cycles; brief spike during snapshot + diff
- **Automatic purge**: old events are removed hourly based on the retention setting
- **WAL mode**: SQLite Write-Ahead Logging ensures reads never block writes

## Data storage

TAR events are stored in `{data_dir}/tar.db` (SQLite), where `data_dir` is the agent's configured data directory. The database uses:

- WAL journal mode for concurrent performance
- `busy_timeout=5000` for thread safety
- `secure_delete=ON` to zero deleted data
- Indexes on `timestamp`, `(event_type, timestamp)`, and `snapshot_id`
