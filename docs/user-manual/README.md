# Yuzu User Manual

Yuzu is an enterprise endpoint management platform -- a single control plane for querying, commanding, patching, and enforcing compliance on Windows, Linux, and macOS fleets in real time. This manual covers day-to-day operations for administrators and operators.

All `curl` examples assume a running Yuzu server at `https://localhost:8080` (HTTPS is enabled by default) and an active admin session cookie in `$COOKIE`. Replace with your session token or API token as appropriate. For development without TLS, start the server with `--no-https`.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Server | Agent | Gateway |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| Linux | x64 (amd64) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Linux | ARM64 (aarch64) | Cross-compiled | Cross-compiled | Yes |
| Windows | x64 | Yes | Yes | -- |
| macOS | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Yes | Yes | -- |
| macOS | x64 (Intel) | Not supported | Not supported | -- |

> **Note:** macOS Intel (x64) builds are not currently produced or tested. Only Apple Silicon (ARM64) Macs running macOS 14+ are supported. If you require macOS Intel support, please open an issue.

## Quick Start

1. **Start the server** -- run `yuzu-server` with a configuration file or accept interactive first-run setup.
2. **Enroll an agent** -- run `yuzu-agent --server <host>:<port>` on a target endpoint. The agent will appear in the pending queue (Tier 1) or auto-enroll with a token (Tier 2).
3. **Approve the agent** -- open the Settings page in the dashboard or use the REST API to approve pending agents.
4. **Run your first instruction** -- see the [Getting Started tutorial](../getting-started.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.
