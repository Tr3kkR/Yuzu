# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Yuzu implements granular role-based access control with deny-overrides-allow semantics, scoped permissions via management groups, and support for both built-in and custom roles.

## Enabling RBAC

RBAC is controlled by a global toggle. When disabled, all authenticated users have full access (with a legacy fallback: write/delete/execute/approve operations still require the `admin` session role) — **except** a small, fixed set of reads that the fallback still refuses to a non-admin; see "The authorization topology floor" below. When enabled, every API call and UI action is checked against the caller's assigned roles.

Toggle RBAC via the Settings page or the server configuration file:

```cfg
[rbac]
enabled = true
```

> **Before enabling RBAC in production:** ensure every operator who needs device
> visibility has at least one management-group role assignment. With RBAC
> **disabled**, all authenticated users see the full enrolled fleet. Turning RBAC
> **on** immediately applies role-scoped visibility — a user without a
> management-group role assignment will see **no agents** (including on the TAR
> fleet scan), and the role-grant endpoints themselves require an existing group
> role, which can be a chicken-and-egg lockout. The broadest grant is an
> `ITServiceOwner` role on the root "All Devices" group; see
> [`management-groups.md`](management-groups.md) for the delegation API.

> **Storage (ADR-0041).** RBAC configuration — roles, grants, principal→role
> assignments, groups + membership, and the global `rbac_enabled` flag — lives in
> the server's **PostgreSQL** substrate, schema `rbac_store` (it moved off the
> legacy SQLite `rbac.db` file). It is a single shared database across all server
> replicas, so administer it with one `psql`, not per-node.
>
> **RBAC store integrity (fail-closed / deny-on-degrade).** The `rbac_store`
> substrate fails **closed at boot** — an unreachable PostgreSQL (or an
> unreadable durable `rbac_enabled` flag) makes the server refuse to start,
> rather than serving RBAC-off on a fleet that enabled it. At runtime, an
> authorization read that cannot resolve (pool-acquire timeout, query error)
> **denies** rather than allowing (deny-on-degrade, ADR-0041 — this closes the
> prior "corrupt `rbac.db` fails open" behavior); watch the
> `yuzu_server_rbac_read_degrade_total` metric. In that degraded state, device
> visibility falls back to the role-scoped path for every caller, so agents stop
> appearing in the dashboard list, `/api/agents`, and TAR fleet scans rather than
> the whole fleet being exposed. **The same fail-closed posture covers MOST
> response/execution readers (#1634):** `query_responses`, `aggregate_responses`,
> `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}/visualization`, and the legacy `GET /api/responses/{id}`
> / `/aggregate` / `/export` surfaces return **zero rows** (the legacy aggregate
> returns `503`) on a corrupt store rather than reopening the cross-operator

## The authorization topology floor (#2376)

Ten reads are treated as **authorization topology** rather than ordinary
operational data. Wherever the legacy RBAC-off fallback is the branch in
effect, they require the `admin` session role — the generic “any Read is
allowed” rule does not reach them. (With RBAC **enabled** they are ordinary
permission checks, so a seeded `Reviewer` holding `AccessReview:Read` is
admitted; the floor never overrides a live RBAC grant.)

| Securable:Operation | Surface |
|---|---|
| `AccessReview:Read` | The fleet-wide access-review grant export (SOC 2 CC6.2 evidence), `GET /api/v1/access-reviews*` |
| `UserManagement:Read` | `GET /api/v1/rbac/roles` and the rest of the RBAC role graph |
| `EnginePrincipal:Read` | The engine-principal inventory and grant graph, `GET /api/v1/engine-principals*` and the `list_engine_principals`/`get_engine_principal`/`list_engine_roles` MCP tools |
| `Enrollment:Read` (#4031) | Auto-approve enrollment rules and pending-agent visibility, `GET /api/v1/enrollment/auto-approve-rules` and `GET /api/v1/enrollment/pending-agents` |
| `OidcConfig:Read` (#4031) | OIDC SSO configuration status, `GET /api/v1/settings/oidc` |
| `TlsConfig:Read` (#4028) | TLS settings read-twins, `GET /api/v1/settings/tls` and `GET /api/v1/settings/https` |
| `PluginSigning:Read` (#4028) | Plugin trust-bundle distribution, `GET /api/v2/agent/plugin-policy` (#4144 — there is deliberately no `/api/v1/settings/plugin-signing` route; the v1 predecessor stayed on `require_admin`) |
| `ServerConfig:Read` (#4028) | Server runtime-configuration read-twins — `GET /api/v1/settings/server-config`, `/settings/gateway`, `/settings/mcp` and `/settings/data-retention` |
| `AnalyticsConfig:Read` (#4028) | Analytics/offload configuration status, `GET /api/v1/settings/analytics` |
| `Forensics:Read` | Windows forensic-artefact and per-device application-usage reads (Wave 7 PR7.2) |

**Why this exists.** With RBAC **disabled**, the legacy fallback described
above allows any authenticated non-engine session to perform every `Read` —
that includes these ten. On a default install (RBAC ships disabled) that
handed a plain `user` session read access to the authorization topology
itself: who holds what role, and the complete access-review grant
population that is supposed to *be* SOC 2 CC6.2 evidence of controlled
access. The floor closes that gap by denying these ten reads to a
non-admin whenever the legacy fallback is the branch in effect — never by
changing behavior under a live RBAC grant.

**This does not affect RBAC-enabled deployments beyond the one closed
gap.** The floor only ever engages inside the legacy (RBAC-off) fallback; a
live RBAC branch always answers first when RBAC is enabled and enforced. In
particular, a non-admin holding the seeded `Reviewer` role (`AccessReview:Read`
+ `AccessReview:Attest`) continues to reach the access-review export exactly
as before — the floor never overrides that grant.

**If you are relying on a non-admin reaching one of these ten reads on an
RBAC-disabled install,** that access is now denied. The supported remedy is
to enable RBAC and grant the appropriate role rather than to expect a
non-admin session to reach authorization topology while RBAC is off:

- For the access-review export: enable RBAC and assign the built-in
  `Reviewer` role (`AccessReview:Read` + `AccessReview:Attest`).
- For `/rbac/roles`: enable RBAC and grant `UserManagement:Read` (the
  built-in `Viewer` role holds it already).
- For the engine-principal inventory/roles reads: enable RBAC and grant
  `EnginePrincipal:Read` (the built-in `Viewer` role holds it already; a
  **custom** role that was granted `Security:Read` specifically to reach
  these routes must be re-granted `EnginePrincipal:Read` — see "Upgrade
  Notes" in [`server-admin.md`](server-admin.md)).
- For the enrollment auto-approve-rules/pending-agents reads: enable RBAC
  and grant `Enrollment:Read` — no built-in non-admin role holds it
  (`Administrator` only; unlike `EnginePrincipal`/`Directory`, `Viewer`
  deliberately does not, since these surfaces gate the fleet's enrollment
  admission policy).
- For the OIDC SSO config status read: enable RBAC and grant
  `OidcConfig:Read` — `Administrator`-only for the same reason.

The floor is deliberately **not configurable** — there is no setting that
widens it back open. It is keyed on `(securable, operation)`, not on route
path, because an MCP tool and a REST route can share the same wire path
(every MCP tool call goes through the single `/mcp/v1/` JSON-RPC endpoint)
while gating different securables; a route-keyed floor could not
distinguish them. A denial from the floor is audited with a distinct reason
(`"topology floor: ..."` on the `auth.permission_required` /
`auth.scoped_permission_required` audit actions, `result=denied`) and
counted in `yuzu_auth_topology_floor_denied_total{permission}`, separate

from an ordinary legacy-fallback denial, so a spike in floored denials is
visible without grepping audit-log text.

See `docs/auth-architecture.md` → "The authorization topology floor
(#2376)" for the full design rationale, and
`docs/security-reviews/authz-topology-floor-2026-08-05.md` for the recorded
decision (including what was deliberately excluded from the floor and why).

**The access-review export's `rbac_enforcement` stamp inherits this same
degrade-vs-outage ambiguity — read this if you're relying on it as
evidence.** `enabled`/`disabled`/`degraded` (full description:
`rest-api.md` → the `GET /api/v1/access-reviews/export` section) is derived
from the identical fail-closed machinery described above under "RBAC store
integrity (fail-closed / deny-on-degrade)" — a replica whose generation
refresh has failed reports `degraded`, same as a replica whose RBAC store is
unreachable. **Correlate against
`yuzu_server_rbac_read_degrade_total{reason=~"generation_refresh_failed.*"}`**
(and the narrower `stale_beyond_accepted_bound` reason) if you need to
distinguish "the store genuinely couldn't confirm state at pull time" from
"an administrator turned RBAC on/off" — the stamp alone cannot make that
distinction for you.

**The frozen campaign row is a strictly worse case than the live export.**
`GET .../export` recomputes `rbac_enforcement` fresh on every pull — a
transient degrade self-corrects the next time someone re-runs the export.
`POST /api/v1/access-reviews` (opening a review campaign) computes the
stamp **once**, at open time, and — per this feature's deliberate no-prune
retention policy — that campaign row persists **indefinitely**. A
`degraded` (or, on the cached-enabled short-circuit documented in
`rest-api.md`, an `enabled`) stamp recorded during a transient partition is
therefore **permanent evidence with no later self-correction**: re-reading
the same closed campaign always returns the value frozen at open, never a
retry. If a campaign was opened during a known RBAC-store incident, treat
its `rbac_enforcement` value as suspect and open a fresh campaign once the
store is confirmed healthy, rather than trusting the frozen one.

**This is an evidence-confidence gap, never a security-control failure.**
A stale or degraded `rbac_enforcement` reading never weakens actual
authorization — `check_permission`/`check_scoped_permission` independently
deny on the exact same degraded view (deny-on-degrade, ADR-0041, as
described throughout this section); nothing about the access-review stamp
being wrong changes what a real request is allowed to do. The risk is
purely that an auditor reading the export or a closed campaign draws the
wrong conclusion about what state RBAC was in — not that access control
itself misbehaves.

## Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Principal** | A user or group identity. Matches the authenticated username or an OIDC group claim. |
| **Role** | A named collection of permissions. Can be system-defined or custom. |
| **Securable type** | A category of resource that permissions apply to (e.g., `Infrastructure`, `Tag`). |
| **Operation** | An action on a securable type (`Read`, `Write`, `Delete`, `Execute`, `Approve`, `Push`, `Attest`, `Rotate`). |
| **Permission** | A single `(securable_type, operation, effect)` entry. Effect is `Allow` or `Deny`. |
| **Role assignment** | Binds a principal to a role, optionally scoped to a management group. |

## System Roles

Seven roles are created automatically and cannot be deleted:

| Role | Permissions | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Administrator** | All 5 CRUD operations on all 38 securable types, plus Push on GuaranteedState, Attest on AccessReview, and Rotate on ApiToken (P2 #11, SOC 2 CC6.3 — self-service human token rotation) (193 permissions) | Server admins, security team leads |
| **PlatformEngineer** | Full CRUD on InstructionDefinition and InstructionSet; Read on Execution, Schedule, Approval, Tag, AuditLog, Response, Inventory; Read/Write/Delete/Push on GuaranteedState | Authors and managers of YAML instruction definitions, sets, and Guardian rules |
| **Operator** | Read/Write/Execute/Delete on InstructionDefinition, InstructionSet, Execution, Schedule, Tag; Read and Approve on Approval; Read on AuditLog, Response, and Inventory; Read and Push on GuaranteedState | Day-to-day instruction execution, schedule management, tagging, and Guardian rule distribution |
| **ApiTokenManager** | Read, Write, Delete, Rotate on ApiToken (4 permissions) | Create, revoke, rotate, and manage API tokens for programmatic access |
| **ITServiceOwner** | All 5 CRUD operations on 18 securable types, plus Push on GuaranteedState, plus Workflow:Read, plus Decommission:Delete (93 permissions). Excludes 20 of the 38 securable types, including UserManagement, Security, ApiToken, AccessReview and EnginePrincipal | Service desk leads, team managers with delegated control over their IT services |
| **Viewer** | Read on 24 securable types (24 permissions) — an explicit allow-list in `rbac_store.cpp`'s seed, *not* “everything except” | Helpdesk staff, auditors, read-only dashboards |
| **Reviewer** | Read and Attest on AccessReview (2 permissions) | Periodic access reviews (SOC 2 CC6.2) — the non-admin role that can attest or flag a grant |

## Securable Types

| Securable type | Description |
|---|---|
| `Infrastructure` | Agent endpoints (query, command, patch) |
| `Tag` | Asset tags applied to devices |
| `InstructionDefinition` | YAML-defined instruction templates |
| `InstructionSet` | Grouped collections of instructions |
| `Execution` | Running or completed instruction instances |
| `Response` | Instruction response data |
| `Schedule` | Cron-style recurring instruction schedules |
| `Approval` | Approval workflow entries |
| `ManagementGroup` | Hierarchical device groups |
| `UserManagement` | User accounts and role assignments |
| `Security` | Security settings (TLS, enrollment) |
| `ApiToken` | API token lifecycle |
| `AuditLog` | Audit event records |
| `Policy` | Guaranteed State policy fragments and composed policies |
| `DeviceToken` | Agent device-token issuance and revocation |
| `SoftwareDeployment` | Software deployment campaigns |
| `License` | Enterprise license records |
| `FileRetrieval` | File upload and download operations |
| `GuaranteedState` | Guardian (Guaranteed State) policy rules, events, and status |
| `Inventory` | Installed-software inventory synced from endpoints (ADR-0016) |
| `EnginePrincipal` | Engine-principal inventory and fleet-wide grant-graph reads (list/get engine principals, list their assigned roles) — cut away from `Security` (#2376) so this narrower read is not gated by the same broad permission that also covers CA/quarantine/KEK operational reads. See "The authorization topology floor" below. |
| `Forensics` | Forensic-artefact reads (Windows execution artefacts — ShimCache/AmCache/Prefetch; per-device application-usage projection). Administrator-only by default (absent from the Viewer read-list); every catalogue row on it is single-target (exactly one agent id, no fleet/scope fan-out) and `AdminOrApproval`-gated. Wave 7 PR7.2/PR7.3. |
| `Decommission` | Device-level agent-erasure gate for `DELETE /api/v1/sle/agents/{id}` (ADR-0024 Decision 9, amended Wave 7 PR7.2). `Decommission:Delete` authorizes for the whole decommission cascade's blast radius (five per-agent stores spanning `Inventory`, `GuaranteedState`, and `SoftwareLicensing`; a companion package adds a sixth, `Forensics`-governed store) in one grant, replacing a hand-maintained per-store conjunction. |
| `SoftwareLicensing` | Discovered software-licence facts synced from endpoints (ADR-0024) |
| `AccessReview` | Periodic access-review campaigns and attestations (SOC 2 CC6.2). Seeded to Administrator and `Reviewer` only — deliberately NOT `AuditLog`, see "The authorization topology floor" above |
| `Workflow` | Multi-step workflow definitions and executions |
| `ProductPack` | Installed product packs |
| `PluginConfig` | Per-plugin configuration and kill switches |
| `PluginSecret` | Per-plugin secret material — never Operator-readable |
| `UploadGrant` | Upload-grant mint/revoke lifecycle |
| `PowerManagement` | `power_health.set_power_plan`, the plugin surface's only destructive power action |
| `Directory` | AD/Entra-synced user and group data |
| `TlsConfig` | TLS settings. Server-administration: denied to every MCP tier, and admin-floored when RBAC is off |
| `PluginSigning` | Plugin-signature enforcement settings. Server-administration, same posture as `TlsConfig` |
| `ServerConfig` | Server runtime configuration. Server-administration, same posture as `TlsConfig` |
| `AnalyticsConfig` | Analytics/offload configuration. Server-administration, same posture as `TlsConfig` |
| `Enrollment` | Auto-approve enrollment rules and pending-agent visibility |
| `OidcConfig` | OIDC SSO configuration |

## Operations

| Operation | Typical meaning |
|---|---|
| `Read` | View or list resources |
| `Write` | Create or modify a resource |
| `Delete` | Remove a resource |
| `Execute` | Run an instruction against devices |
| `Approve` | Approve a pending workflow item |
| `Push` | Distribute an existing rule set to scoped agents. Consumed **only** by `GuaranteedState` REST handlers and seeded **only** on `GuaranteedState` — separates deploy authority from authoring authority. Present in the operations catalogue so custom roles can adopt it, but the default seeds grant it on `GuaranteedState` alone. |
| `Attest` | Record a reviewer's attestation decision on a periodic access review (SOC 2 CC6.2). Consumed **only** by `AccessReview` REST handlers and seeded **only** on `AccessReview` — gated via the dedicated `AccessReview` securable, never `AuditLog` (see "The authorization topology floor" below). |
| `Rotate` (P2 #11, SOC 2 CC6.3) | Self-service overlap-pair rotation of a human-owned API token. Consumed **only** by `ApiToken` REST/MCP handlers and seeded **only** on `ApiToken`, to the same two roles that already hold `ApiToken:Write` (`Administrator`, `ApiTokenManager`) — deliberately a separate operation from `Write` so a narrower MCP-tier allowance can be granted for rotation without also widening token-mint access. |

## Permission Resolution

Yuzu evaluates permissions with **deny-overrides-allow**:

1. Collect all roles assigned to the principal (direct user assignments + group assignments).
2. Gather all permissions from those roles for the requested `(securable_type, operation)`.
3. If any permission has effect `Deny`, the request is **denied**.
4. If at least one permission has effect `Allow`, the request is **allowed**.
5. If no matching permission exists, the request is **denied** (implicit deny).

### Scoped Permissions

When a resource belongs to a management group (e.g., a device in "London Servers"), the permission check works in two passes:

1. **Global check** -- roles assigned without a group scope (via the `principal_roles` table) are evaluated first using standard deny-overrides-allow. If the user has a global allow, the request is permitted immediately.
2. **Scoped check** -- the system finds the agent's management group memberships, then collects all ancestor groups (child to root). For every group in this set, it looks up scoped role assignments (stored in the `ManagementGroupStore`) that match the user directly or via RBAC group membership. All matching permissions are evaluated with deny-overrides-allow: any deny returns false; otherwise, if at least one allow is found, the request is permitted.

This means a role scoped to a parent group automatically covers all child groups.

## API Reference

All REST API v1 responses are wrapped in a standard JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "data": ...,
  "meta": { "api_version": "v1" }
}
```

List endpoints add a `pagination` field:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": { "total": 6, "start": 0, "page_size": 50 },
  "meta": { "api_version": "v1" }
}
```

### Check Permission

Verify whether the current user has a specific permission. Useful for UI feature gating or pre-flight checks in scripts.

**Note:** This endpoint uses `POST`, not `GET`, because it accepts a JSON request body.

```bash
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rbac/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "securable_type": "Infrastructure",
    "operation": "Execute"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allowed": true
  },
  "meta": { "api_version": "v1" }
}
```

A denied response (the `allowed` field is `false`; no reason string is returned):

```json
{
  "data": {
    "allowed": false
  },
  "meta": { "api_version": "v1" }
}
```

### List Roles

```bash
curl -s -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rbac/roles
```

```json

### Get Role Permissions

```bash
curl -s -b cookies.txt \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rbac/roles/ITServiceOwner/permissions
```

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "securable_type": "Approval", "operation": "Approve", "effect": "allow" },
    { "securable_type": "Approval", "operation": "Delete", "effect": "allow" },
    { "securable_type": "Approval", "operation": "Execute", "effect": "allow" },
    { "securable_type": "Approval", "operation": "Read", "effect": "allow" },

```

(Truncated for brevity. The full ITServiceOwner role contains 93 permissions across 18 securable types — the 90 CRUD grants plus three targeted ones: `GuaranteedState:Push`, `Workflow:Read` (#4030) and `Decommission:Delete` (Wave 7 PR7.2).)

### Custom Roles (Planned)

Custom roles can be created programmatically via `RbacStore::create_role()` and permissions assigned via `RbacStore::set_permission()`. REST API endpoints for role **creation** are planned but **not yet implemented** — there is no HTMX Settings UI fragment for this either (`settings_routes.cpp` has no RBAC role-CRUD registration). Currently, a genuinely NEW custom role can only be created directly against the shared PostgreSQL `rbac_store` schema (see the "Storage (ADR-0041)" callout above — one `psql` session, not a per-node file).

**Assigning one of the 6 fleet-wide-assignable built-in roles to a human user is implemented — see "Fleet-Wide Role Assignment" below** (`ITServiceOwner`, the 7th built-in role, is assignable only at management-group scope — see "Scoped Role Assignments"). Only AUTHORING a brand-new custom role (and narrowing/widening a seeded system role's own permission set) remains planned.

**Planned endpoints (not yet available):**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/rbac/roles` | Create a custom role |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/rbac/roles/{name}` | Update a role |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/rbac/roles/{name}` | Delete a custom role |

### Fleet-Wide Role Assignment (Built-in Roles)

An Administrator can grant or revoke one of the 6 non-`ITServiceOwner` built-in roles (`Administrator`, `PlatformEngineer`, `Operator`, `ApiTokenManager`, `Viewer`, `Reviewer`) to a human (`principal_type="user"`) user, fleet-wide, through a dedicated pair of routes — **not** the general RBAC-securable `perm_fn`/`require_permission` gate every other route in this document uses. Granting (and especially revoking) standing Administrator authority is a stronger security decision than an ordinary permission check, so the caller must hold a **durable** Administrator role themselves, re-read fresh from the store rather than trusted from a cached session role or a JIT (`POST /api/v1/elevate`) elevation — an elevated session does **not** satisfy this gate.

```bash
# Grant the Operator role to a user, fleet-wide
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rbac/roles/Operator/assignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "principal_type": "user",
    "principal_id": "jane.doe"
  }'

# Revoke it again
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X DELETE \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/rbac/roles/Operator/assignments/jane.doe
```

Key constraints:

- **`principal_type` must be `"user"`.** Group-scoped fleet-wide assignment is not supported yet — `rbac_store.group_members` is written solely by IdP group-sync, so a group-held grant would make the IdP the admin-authority source, a decision not made by this surface.
- **`ITServiceOwner` is explicitly rejected**, not silently mis-assigned. Its 92-permission grant is designed around the holder being CONFINED to devices tagged with their IT Service — but that confinement is enforced entirely by `ManagementGroupStore::get_visible_agents`, which reads only the group-scoped `management_group_roles` table, never `principal_roles` (this surface's only write target). A fleet-wide `ITServiceOwner` grant would resolve unconfined/global on every type-level permission check while showing the holder zero visible devices on any per-device list read — wrong both ways. Assign `ITServiceOwner` via the management-group role route instead (see "Scoped Role Assignments" below).
- **Only the 6 named roles above are accepted** — enforced against a closed allow-list (`rbac_assignable_roles.hpp`), not "any role that happens to exist in the store". A pre-existing custom role (`is_system=false`, creatable only via direct SQL today — `RbacStore::create_role` has no route caller) is rejected exactly like an unknown role name. An unknown/custom role name and `ITServiceOwner` all return the identical client-facing rejection message — the specific reason is recorded in the audit log only, so a caller cannot enumerate the role catalog by diffing error text.
- **A caller may not revoke the fleet's last remaining `Administrator` grant through this surface.** The store-level guard runs inside the same transaction as the delete, so two concurrent revokes cannot both succeed and leave zero administrators. It counts only `principal_type='user'` rows that ALSO name a currently-active `auth.users` account — a grant naming a nonexistent, deactivated, or (soft-)deleted username is never treated as a survivor.
  - **This guard covers only THIS route's own unassign path** — it does not, on its own, guarantee the fleet always has a *usable* administrator. Deactivating or deleting the account behind the fleet's last Administrator grant is a **separate, unguarded** path (account lifecycle management, not role-grant management) that can still leave zero authenticatable administrators. Tracked as a real gap in [#4966](https://github.com/Tr3kkR/Yuzu/issues/4966).
  - **An SSO (OIDC/SAML) Administrator cannot receive a `principal_roles` grant through THIS surface at all, which is a usability limitation for SSO fleets, not a security gap — and not because the row can't exist.** The real mechanism: this route's `principal_id` charset check (`is_valid_username` — alphanumeric plus `.`/`_`/`-`, 1–64 characters) rejects the stable SSO principal formats outright before an assignment is ever attempted — OIDC's `"oidc:" + iss + "#" + sub` and SAML's `"saml:" + entity_id + "#" + name_id` (`oidc_principal_id`/`saml_principal_id`) both contain `:` and `#`, neither of which the charset allows. So a `principal_roles` row naming an SSO principal can never be WRITTEN via this route in the first place — a stricter, earlier-stage gap than "the row doesn't exist". Whether an `auth.users` row separately exists for the principal differs by protocol and doesn't change this: **OIDC** *does* durably provision one — every successful OIDC login calls `AuthManager::provision_sso_identity` → `AuthDB::upsert_sso_identity`, an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (username) DO UPDATE` that creates (first login) or refreshes (every login after) a real, `is_active=TRUE`-by-default `auth.users` row keyed on the same stable principal — but that row is moot for this guard, since no `principal_roles` row can ever be assigned to that principal_id to begin with. **SAML**, by contrast, provisions no `auth.users` row at all today — `AuthManager::create_saml_session` only writes the session store, never `AuthDB` — so for SAML the original "no `auth.users` row" framing happens to still hold, just not for a reason that matters once the charset check is understood. Net effect: an SSO principal is entirely outside this guard's count — its `principal_id` format can never reach `principal_roles` via this route at all, so there is no "SSO grant this guard fails to recognize." Every grant the guard can ever count arrives through THIS route (the only writer of `principal_roles` Administrator rows for `principal_type="user"`), so in practice it only ever counts local-account grants (`AuthDB` usernames, not `oidc:`/`saml:`-prefixed ones) — the guard's own JOIN has no charset restriction and would count an `oidc:`/`saml:`-prefixed row too if one existed, but this route can never write one. Since the last-Administrator fix above (governance ledger `a2-p7-doomgoose-1`), a local grant that was never counted — a ghost (no matching `auth.users` row) or deactivated-account grant — no longer blocks its own removal; the guard only refuses when removing a grant that WAS itself counted would take the count to zero. Also tracked in [#4966](https://github.com/Tr3kkR/Yuzu/issues/4966) (see that issue for a correction to its own originally-stated mechanism).
- **Assigning a role to a username with no existing account is allowed** (pre-provisioning) — RBAC's `principal_roles` and `AuthDB`'s `users` table are independent, unrelated by foreign key.
- MCP twins: `assign_rbac_role` / `unassign_rbac_role` — see `docs/user-manual/mcp.md`.

> **Before enabling RBAC, mint at least one `principal_roles` Administrator
> row first — same chicken-and-egg hazard as the management-group callout
> above, in this route's own currency.** With RBAC **enabled** (and no legacy
> fallback available), `is_rbac_administrator`'s RBAC-on branch requires a

> the predicate's OTHER branch) to assign the first `Administrator` grant
> before re-enabling, or mint the first grant directly against `rbac_store.
> principal_roles` (see the "Storage (ADR-0041)" callout above for the shared
> Postgres substrate) before ever flipping the toggle on a fresh install.

### Scoped Role Assignments

Scoped role assignments bind a principal to a role within a specific management group. These are stored in the `ManagementGroupStore` (not in the RBAC principal_roles table) and are managed through the management group API:

```bash
# Assign a role scoped to a management group
curl -s -b cookies.txt -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/management-groups/mg_london_office/roles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "principal_type": "user",
    "principal_id": "jane.doe",
    "role_name": "Operator"
  }'
```

## Examples

### Deny a Specific Operation

Prevent a role from deleting infrastructure resources, even if other roles would allow it. This requires creating a custom role with a Deny permission (via direct database access, since the role creation API is not yet available — no HTMX Settings UI fragment exists for this either):

```sql
-- Example: create a deny role directly against the shared rbac_store schema
-- (psql against the server's PostgreSQL instance — see the "Storage (ADR-0041)"
-- callout above; this is a single shared store, not a per-node SQLite file).
INSERT INTO rbac_store.roles (name, description, is_system, created_at)
  VALUES ('NoDeletion', 'Explicit deny on infrastructure deletion', false, extract(epoch from now())::bigint);
INSERT INTO rbac_store.role_permissions (role_name, securable_type, operation, effect)
  VALUES ('NoDeletion', 'Infrastructure', 'Delete', 'deny');
```

Assign this role alongside any other roles. Because deny overrides allow, the user will be unable to delete infrastructure resources regardless of their other role assignments.
