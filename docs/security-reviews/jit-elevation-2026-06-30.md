# Security review — JIT admin elevation (SOC 2 CC6.3/CC6.6)

**Date:** 2026-06-30
**Change:** Just-in-time admin elevation — a pre-authorized operator activates a
time-boxed, justified, MFA-gated admin window via `POST /api/v1/elevate`, then
auto-reverts. Eligibility is the per-user `users.elevation_eligible` flag
(admin-managed via `POST /api/v1/users/<name>/elevation-eligibility`).
**Branch:** `feat/auth-jit-elevation`
**Controls:** SOC 2 **CC6.3** (least privilege — reduce standing admin), **CC6.6**
(privileged access — time-boxed, justified, MFA-gated, audited). Closes
`/auth-and-authz` gap-matrix **P1 #9**.

## What shipped

- **`POST /api/v1/elevate`** `{justification (required), duration_secs}` — sets
  the in-memory `Session::elevated_until = now + min(duration, --jit-max-elevation-secs)`
  (default 1h, max 24h). `auth::effective_role(session)` returns `admin` while
  the window is live; `require_admin` gates on it and
  `require_permission`/`require_scoped_permission` short-circuit to allow an
  elevated session. The same `effective_role` is honoured at the previously
  raw-`role` admin-bypass sites (workflow role-gated approval, cross-user API
  token revoke, the dashboard token-list filter) so "elevated = full admin" is
  uniform for the window.
- **`POST /api/v1/elevate/revoke`** — manual step-down. **`--jit-max-elevation-secs`**
  (`YUZU_JIT_MAX_ELEVATION_SECS`).
- **Eligibility** — `users.elevation_eligible` (auth.db migration v5; renumbered
  from v4 at merge after break-glass #1735 took v4 on dev), set via
  `POST /api/v1/users/<name>/elevation-eligibility` (`AuthDB::set_elevation_eligible`/
  `is_elevation_eligible`, parameterised, `RETURNING`, fail-closed read).

## Control / authz decisions

- **MFA is mandatory to elevate, unconditionally (security-F1).** Elevation is
  the privilege-crossing boundary (non-admin → full admin), so — unlike the other
  11 step-up sites where the actor is already admin — an eligible operator with
  **no enrolled second factor** is hard-denied 403 (not merely passed through
  under `--mfa-enforcement=optional`). Enrollment + a fresh step-up are both
  required. Deliberately mirrors the break-glass "no bare-password privilege"
  posture (#1735 UP-1).
- **Cookie sessions only.** `/api/v1/elevate` reads the session cookie and
  `elevate_session` keys on the cookie token; API/MCP tokens resolve via
  `synthesize_token_session` (no cookie, no `elevated_until`), so an automation
  credential can **never** be elevated, and the permission-gate short-circuits are
  unreachable by them.
- **Grant audit is fail-closed (UP-3).** If `role.elevation.granted` can't
  persist, the elevation is rolled back (compensating `revoke_elevation`) and the
  call 500s with `Sec-Audit-Failed` — a privileged activation never stands
  without a record (mirrors the break-glass arm).
- **Revoking eligibility terminates active elevations (UP-1).**
  `set_elevation_eligible(false)` calls `AuthManager::revoke_user_elevations`, so
  an incident-response "revoke now" drops the operator's admin access immediately
  rather than leaving it standing for the window — symmetric with the session
  wipe on demote/delete.
- **Self-grant blocked (UP-6).** An operator (including one acting under an
  active elevation) cannot set their own eligibility, so a temporary admin window
  can't manufacture a durable self-elevation right. Eligibility is always granted
  by another admin, and the grant records the granting actor.
- **Monotonic, in-memory window.** `elevated_until` is `steady_clock` (an NTP
  step can't extend it) and per-session in-memory — a restart or logout drops the
  elevation (fail-safe; nothing in auth.db resurrects it). It cannot outlive the
  session's absolute expiry (`validate_session` rejects past `expires_at`).

## Hermes pre-submission pass-1 fixes

- **`duration_secs` > INT_MAX → 500.** A JSON integer above `INT_MAX` passed
  `is_number_integer()` but `get<int>()` threw → 500. Now read as `int64_t`,
  range-checked, then narrowed (over-cap clamps to the window).
- **TOCTOU: eligibility revoked during the step-up delay.** Eligibility is
  re-checked immediately before `elevate_session` (the human-time MFA step-up sits
  between the first check and the grant), so an admin who revokes mid-step-up wins
  the race — `role.elevation.denied` / `detail=eligibility revoked during step-up`.
- **Step-up escape hatch on the privilege boundary.** The elevation step-up floors
  the window to 300 s when the operator has globally disabled step-up
  (`--mfa-step-up-window-secs <= 0`), so elevation ALWAYS requires a fresh proof
  even when the gate is disabled elsewhere. (For a local enrolled user
  `require_mfa_step_up` already runs the freshness check regardless of
  `--mfa-enforcement`; the floor closes the one remaining global-disable path.)
- **Audit gap on step-up refusal.** A refused elevation step-up now also emits
  `role.elevation.denied` / `detail=mfa_step_up_refused`, completing the
  elevation-specific trail beside the shared `mfa.step_up` row.

## Tr3kkR adversarial review (Codex vs Kimi) fixes — #1748

- **H1 — audit `principal_role` understated the effective role.** `make_audit_event`
  / `emit_event` (auth_routes) and the four `settings_routes` token-management rows
  stamped `principal_role` from the **base** `session->role` while authorizing via
  `effective_role` — so an action authorized as admin under an active elevation was
  logged as `user`. All six now stamp `auth::role_to_string(auth::effective_role(*session))`
  (a no-op for non-elevated sessions). Test: an elevated admin action records
  `principal_role=admin`.
- **H2 — migration-version collision.** Break-glass #1735 merged to `dev` first and
  took `v4`; the JIT `elevation_eligible` migration is **renumbered to `v5`** and the
  branch rebased on current `dev`, so the migrations are contiguous and the collision
  can never silently skip.
- **H3 — non-A4 admin-denial envelope.** `POST /api/v1/users/<name>/elevation-eligibility`
  no longer borrows `require_admin`'s legacy `{error:{code,message}}` 403; it runs an
  **inline A4 admin gate** (token-type guards + `effective_role`, `auth.admin_required`
  audit) returning the A4 envelope with the route's `X-Correlation-Id`.
- **M1 — discovery (A2).** The three routes (`/elevate`, `/elevate/revoke`,
  `/users/{username}/elevation-eligibility`) are added to `openapi_spec()` with request
  schemas + A4 error responses; a route-presence test guards them.
- **L2 — UTF-8 truncation.** The 1 KiB justification cap now backs up to a code-point
  boundary so the audit detail never ends mid-sequence.

## Threats considered (governance pipeline, 8 reviewers + Hermes ×2)

- **Privilege escalation without eligibility / without MFA.** No path: eligibility
  is admin-granted + read fail-closed; MFA enrollment + step-up are mandatory.
- **Token elevation.** Impossible (cookie-only; verified by security-guardian).
- **Justification log/audit injection.** Control bytes (incl. DEL) → space; 1 KiB
  cap; non-empty required; goes into the audit detail as a trailing field.
- **Malformed body / negative-duration least-privilege miss.** Wrong-typed fields
  and negative durations are `400` (not a 500, not a silent max-window grant).

## Residual risks (accepted / tracked)

- **An elevated operator can create standing admins / grant others' eligibility.**
  Inherent to "elevation = full admin" (a standing admin can too); self-grant is
  blocked and every eligibility change is audited with the actor. Access reviews
  must enumerate `users.elevation_eligible` and cross-check the granting actor.
- **Migration v4 collides with the break-glass PR (#1735, also v4).** A merge-gate
  renumber-to-v5 item, flagged in-code.
- **OIDC-only operators cannot elevate (v1 limitation).** The mandatory-MFA gate
  checks the local `mfa_status`, so an SSO operator with no local TOTP is
  fail-closed-denied. Elevation gated on the OIDC `amr` assertion is a tracked
  follow-up — safe-but-restrictive for SSO-first deployments.

## Follow-ups shipped (2026-07-02)

Both `expires_in`/`expired`-event follow-ups flagged above have shipped:

- **Follow-up A — `role.elevation.expired` on passive lapse.** Emitted LAZILY (no
  new background thread) by `AuthManager::reap_expired_elevation`, called from the
  `AuthRoutes::resolve_session` cookie chokepoint on the operator's first
  authenticated request after the window elapses. Clears `elevated_until` to the
  sentinel on the first observing call, so emission is exactly-once; a manual
  `revoke_elevation`/`revoke_user_elevations` clears the same sentinel first, so a
  manual step-down never ALSO produces a spurious `expired` row (verified by test).
  **The audit emission itself is best-effort / at-most-once, not exactly-once
  end-to-end:** the sentinel is cleared BEFORE the audit call, so a store failure
  loses only the confirmatory `expired` row — the reap (session reverting to base
  role) still happens regardless, and the window's end remains reconstructible
  from the earlier, fail-closed `role.elevation.granted` row's
  `duration_secs`/`expires_at` (verified by a broken-`AuditStore` test — no
  crash/throw, elevation still reaped). **Accepted boundary:** an operator who
  elevates and then abandons the session (closes the browser, lets it idle)
  without another authenticated request never triggers the lazy reap — no event
  fires for that lapse, though the window's end remains reconstructible from the
  `granted` row's `duration_secs`/`expires_at`. The same boundary applies to idle
  (inactivity) session eviction: if the idle reaper evicts the session first, the
  next request never reaches the cookie-found branch, so the lazy reap likewise
  never fires.
- **Follow-up B — absolute `expires_at` + session-lifetime clamp.**
  `AuthManager::elevate_session` now clamps
  `elevated_until = min(now + min(duration, --jit-max-elevation-secs), session.expires_at)`
  — an elevation can never outlive the cookie session that carries it.
  `POST /api/v1/elevate`'s response now reports the TRUE remaining time as
  `expires_in` (computed after any clamp, so it is `<=` the requested/capped
  duration) plus a wall-clock `expires_at` (RFC3339 UTC). The
  `role.elevation.granted` audit detail carries `expires_at` too, and the
  analytics `emit_event` now carries the same post-clamp `duration_secs` as the
  audit row and response body (all three channels agree).
- **Governance hardening round (2026-07-02) — dead-window guard (UP-1/UP-4,
  merge-blocker, fixed).** A session that crosses its own absolute `expires_at`
  between `validate_session` and `elevate_session` previously clamped to
  `until <= now` and was still granted: a `200 ok` with `expires_in:0` that
  misled a scripted caller into believing it held admin, followed by a spurious
  `role.elevation.expired` for a window that never actually conferred privilege.
  `AuthManager::elevate_session` now detects `until <= now` BEFORE mutating the
  session and returns `nullopt` — the handler's existing nullopt→401 path
  ("session vanished between validate and elevate") covers it, so a dead window
  is now REJECTED (401), never a zero-privilege `200 ok` grant.
- Tests: `tests/unit/server/test_auth_jit_elevation.cpp` `[jit]`, 26 cases / 434
  assertions (empirically verified via the Catch2 binary's own summary line, not
  a grep of `TEST_CASE`) — cumulative across both hardening rounds: elevate_session
  session-lifetime clamp; reap_expired_elevation exactly-once +
  no-op-after-manual-revoke; REST-level lazy-expiry audit + no-double-emit +
  no-emit-after-revoke; `expires_at` presence/format and
  `expires_in <= requested` on the existing grant/cap-clamp REST cases (updated
  from exact-equality to `<=`/tolerance since `expires_in` is now the true
  post-grant remaining time); the dead-window rejection (`elevate_session`
  returns nullopt for a session already at/past its own expiry, via a new
  TEST-ONLY `expire_session_for_test` seam); concurrent TOCTOU reap
  exactly-once under two racing threads; a lazy reap surviving an unwritable
  `AuditStore` without crashing; a reap firing within a request resolves that
  SAME request to base role; the `role.elevation.granted` audit detail carrying
  `expires_at=`.

## Validation

- Unit: `tests/unit/server/test_auth_jit_elevation.cpp` `[jit]` — **26 cases /
  434 assertions** (current, post-hardening-round count; reconciled from the
  original ship's 15 cases / 275 assertions via the Catch2 binary's own
  printed summary, the authoritative source — not a grep of `TEST_CASE`) —
  `effective_role`/`is_elevated`, `AuthManager` elevate/revoke/
  revoke-user-elevations/reap_expired_elevation, `AuthDB` eligibility, and the
  REST surface end-to-end (granted; elevated-passes-admin-gate;
  **MFA-enrollment-mandatory**; **stale-proof-challenged**;
  ineligible-denied; justification-required; **wrong-typed/negative-duration
  → 400**; duration-clamp; revoke-reverts; **eligibility-revoke-kills-elevation**;
  **self-grant-blocked**; tokenless-rejected; session-lifetime clamp;
  **dead-window rejection**; lazy passive-expiry reap (exactly-once,
  no-op-after-revoke, **concurrent-TOCTOU exactly-once**,
  **survives-unwritable-audit-store**, **reap-within-request-resolves-base-role**);
  `expires_at` presence/format + audit-detail substring). Broader
  `[auth][mfa][session][rbac][rest][workflow][settings][token]` suite green
  (6280+ assertions as of the original ship; re-verified green post-hardening
  via the full `server` meson test suite); server build + link clean.
- Governance pipeline: security-guardian PASS (no CRITICAL/HIGH; MEDIUM F1 fixed
  in the hardening round); authdb / cpp-safety / consistency-auditor / happy-path
  PASS; quality-engineer BLOCKING (untested step-up gate) + unhappy-path UP-1/UP-3
  fixed; docs-writer BLOCKING (rest-api) addressed (this record + rest-api +
  authentication + audit-log + server-admin + CHANGELOG + SKILL).
