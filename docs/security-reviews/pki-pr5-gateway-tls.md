# Security review — PKI PR5: gateway upstream mTLS + per-agent enrollment through the gateway

- **Date:** 2026-06-04
- **Change:** `feat/pki-pr5` (gateway upstream mutual TLS reference config, `agent_pb`/`gateway_pb`/`management_pb` regen so per-agent enrollment forwards through the gateway, fail-closed-on-unverified startup guard, accurate TLS-posture logging)
- **Reviewers:** Hermes ×2 (adversarial + Anthropic cybersecurity skill-pack); `/governance` Gates 2–6 (security-guardian, docs-writer, gateway-erlang, architect, happy/unhappy/consistency, compliance/sre/enterprise-readiness)
- **SOC 2 controls:** CC6.1, CC6.6, CC6.7 (transmission encryption), CC6.8 (key/crypto management), CC3.2 (risk identification), CC7.2 (change management)

## Scope

The Erlang gateway is an **optional** scale-out command fan-out plane between agents
and the C++ server. This change (a) enables mutual TLS on the gateway→server upstream
hop as a reference config, (b) fixes a silent field-drop so the per-agent enrollment
CSR **survives transit** through the gateway — note this is plumbing only; the gateway
path does **not** sign the forwarded CSR (ProxyRegister has no signer in PR5, so a
gateway-connected agent still gets an empty `issued_certificate` and fails closed to
bootstrap), gateway-path **issuance lands in PR5d** — and (c) makes the gateway's TLS
posture honest + fail-closed.
It does **not** change the agent↔gateway transport (still plaintext — see residual risk
R-1) and does **not** flip the shipped images/composes to TLS-by-default (that is PR5b).

## Threats considered

- **Passive eavesdropping / active MITM on the gateway→server hop.** Mitigated:
  mutual TLS (CA-issued `default-gateway` leaf, `verify_peer`, TLS 1.2 floor,
  ECDHE-ECDSA AEAD/PFS cipher whitelist, depth 2). A real EC mutual-TLS handshake +
  certless-client-rejection are unit-proven. Boot **fails closed** if the channel is
  `https` without `verify_peer` (`evaluate_upstream_posture/2`).
- **Silent downgrade to plaintext.** Mitigated: the latent bug (listener
  `transport_opts` missing grpcbox's required `ssl => true`) is removed; `log_tls_state/0`
  classifies and warns on `unverified`/`plaintext`; the upstream guard refuses boot on
  `unverified`.
- **Confused-deputy via forwarded `csr_pem`.** Not exploitable **in PR5** — but ONLY
  because the gateway path performs no signing yet (B-1). The non-exploitability does
  **not** survive PR5d on its own: once the gateway path signs, the *unauthenticated*
  agent↔gateway hop makes the gateway a confused deputy on the enrollment path. A
  malicious/on-path gateway could (UP-1) swap the agent's CSR for its own keypair — the
  server keys identity off the relayed enrollment token and ignores CSR subject/SAN, so
  it would issue a CA-signed cert for the **victim's `agent_id`** (persistent credential
  forgery); or (UP-2) strip `csr_pem` to silently downgrade the agent to no-mTLS forever.
  **R-6 (hard gate on PR5d):** the gateway must add agent-identity *attestation* — not
  just transport mTLS — before it forwards enrollment. Tracked in
  `docs/pki-architecture.md` deferred follow-ups. In PR5 today the agent↔gateway hop is
  plaintext (R-1) and signing is absent, so neither UP-1 nor UP-2 is live yet.
- **Proto field-drop in transit.** Was the live bug (gpb self-contained modules); fixed by
  regenerating all three embedding modules + per-module roundtrip tests. CI codegen-guard
  is follow-up F-3.

## Residual risks (risk register)

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Compensating control | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **R-1** | **Plaintext agent↔gateway listener (`:50051`).** On an untrusted-network-exposed gateway, an on-path attacker can inject `CommandRequest`s (fleet RCE), read inventory, or impersonate the gateway. No transport auth/confidentiality on that hop. | Med (deployment-dependent) | **Critical** | Deployment-layer: TLS-terminating proxy in front of `:50051`, or keep on a trusted network (VPN/private subnet/mesh). Documented in `gateway.md`, `security-hardening.md`, `sys.config.prod`, CHANGELOG. Direct agent→server is full mTLS. | **PR5c SHIPPED the native fix's capability** — a vendored+patched grpcbox (`_checkouts/grpcbox`) enables one-way (server-authenticated) TLS on the agent listener (encrypted + gateway-authenticated, no client cert, bootstrap-safe), turned on in `sys.config.prod`. Residual: live-wiring + CA-to-agent distribution in **PR5b** (shipped composes plaintext until then → the deployment mitigation still applies). QUIC (#376) is the longer-term path. |
| **R-2** | **`YUZU_GW_TLS_*` env vars are inert** — they set an advisory `yuzu_gw` env nothing consumes; an operator may believe they enabled TLS. | Low | Med (plaintext upstream by surprise) | `log_tls_state/0` warns unconditionally when the env is set; fail-closed guard catches the resulting `unverified`/plaintext on the upstream. | Env-substituted `sys.config.src` so `YUZU_GW_TLS_*` drive grpcbox cert paths (P1 before any gateway-enabled enterprise deployment guide). |
| **R-3** | **Upstream-TLS failures are not distinctly observable** — expired/wrong-SAN cert / missing volume collapse to a generic circuit-open; an operator can't tell "cert broke" from "server down". | Med | Med (extended incident / MTTR) | Existing circuit-breaker telemetry + `/readyz` 503; startup posture log. | Dedicated `yuzu_gw_upstream_tls_handshake_failures_total` counter + runtime posture gauge (follow-up F-1). |
| **R-4** | **Cert-SAN ↔ dial-name** mismatch silently strands a cross-host gateway (OTP enforces SNI under `verify_peer`). | Med | Med | Documented SAN/`hostname:` requirement in `sys.config.prod` + `pki-architecture.md`. | `--cert-san` flag to add SANs to default certs — **SHIPPED (PR5b)**. |

## Tracked follow-ups

- **F-1** — `yuzu_gw_upstream_tls_handshake_failures_total` counter (classify `tls_alert`/`handshake_failure` in `do_rpc`) + a runtime TLS-posture gauge (R-3, sre).
- **F-2** — message-size cap (`max_recv_message_length`) on the gateway listener so an oversized `csr_pem`/any field can't pressure memory (pre-existing for all fields).
- **F-3** — CI guard: regenerate all gateway `_pb.erl` from the vendored protos + diff against committed, and assert every multi-module-embedded message has an identical `{name,fnum,type}` set matching canonical (would convert R-of-drift into a hard CI failure).
- **F-4** — `via=gateway_proxy` in the server's `ca.cert.issued` audit `detail` when signing arrives via `ProxyRegister` (direct vs proxied issuance traceability).
- **F-5** — CAIQ/security-questionnaire answer for "is all agent traffic encrypted in transit?" (see "Customer assurance" below).

## Customer assurance (questionnaire answer)

> Agent-to-server connections are protected by mutual TLS (per-agent certificates issued
> by Yuzu's internal CA). When the optional Erlang gateway scale-out plane is deployed,
> the gateway-to-server upstream is also mutual TLS. The gateway agent listener now
> supports server-authenticated (one-way) TLS (PKI PR5c — capability shipped in
> `sys.config.prod` via a vendored patched grpcbox); distributing the CA to agents and
> wiring the deployed composes is PR5b. Until PR5b, any internet-exposed gateway
> deployment must protect that hop at the network layer (TLS-terminating proxy or
> private/VPN network). Direct-connect deployments (no gateway) are fully encrypted
> end-to-end.

## Verdict

Net security improvement; no CRITICAL/HIGH unresolved. R-1's native fix **capability shipped
in PR5c** (one-way TLS on the agent listener); the residual until **PR5b** wires it live +
distributes the CA is a **documented, deployment-mitigated** risk, acceptable for M1 provided
the network-layer mitigation is enforced for any exposed gateway. The shipped reference config
+ proto fix are unit-proven (PR5: 194 eunit; PR5c: 200 eunit, dialyzer clean, real EC mutual-
and one-way-TLS handshakes).
