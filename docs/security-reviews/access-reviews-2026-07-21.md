# Security review — Periodic access reviews (SOC 2 CC6.2)

**Date:** 2026-07-21
**Change:** `GET/POST /api/v1/access-reviews*` + `access_review_model.{hpp,cpp}` +
`access_review_store.{hpp,cpp}` + MCP twins (`export_access_review`,
`open_access_review`, `record_attestation`, `get_access_review`,
`list_access_reviews`, `close_access_review`)
**Branch:** `feat/auth-access-reviews`
**Control:** SOC 2 **CC6.2** (logical access — periodic review and, where
appropriate, revocation of access). Closes the `/auth-and-authz` gap
"Periodic access reviews with manager/security attestation" (previously
listed **MISSING**; Priority-2 item 12).

## What shipped

- **Export (stateless):** `GET /api/v1/access-reviews/export?format=json|csv`
  — every user/group/engine-principal's **direct** role grants right now,
  with `effective_permission_count`, last activity, `classification`,
  `lifecycle_state`, and `source` (provenance). Built by the pure read-model
  `access_review_model.hpp` (`build_access_review`), which reads `AuthDB`,
  `RbacStore`, and `EnginePrincipalStore` (required — a null pointer or a
  closed store fails the whole call), plus optional `ApiTokenStore`/
  `DirectorySync` enrichment. **Grant-table-driven (UP-1, hardening
  round):** the export's spine is the grant table, not any roster — a
  principal with zero grants produces no row (the export answers "who
  currently has access", not "who exists"), and a grant belonging to a
  principal outside every roster is surfaced as a `source="orphan"`,
  `lifecycle_state="unknown"` row rather than silently dropped. **CSV
  formula-injection neutralized (hardening round, CWE-1236):** any field
  whose first byte is `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`/tab/CR is `'`-prefixed before RFC-4180
  quoting.
- **Campaign list:** `GET /api/v1/access-reviews` (hardening round) lists
  every campaign's metadata (not its attestations), newest-first, capped at
  the most recent 500 — the surface an auditor needs to prove reviews ran
  on cadence without already knowing a `campaign_id` out-of-band.
- **Attestation campaigns (durable):** `POST /api/v1/access-reviews` opens a
  campaign that **freezes the complete current grant population** as
  `pending` attestation rows in one transaction; `POST
  /api/v1/access-reviews/{id}/attestations` records a reviewer decision
  (`attested`/`flagged_revoke`) against one frozen `(principal, role)` grant
  — an UPSERT that overwrites a prior decision on a re-call; `POST
  /api/v1/access-reviews/{id}/close` closes the campaign; `GET
  /api/v1/access-reviews/{id}` returns the full evidentiary state
  (metadata + every attestation row + `pending_count`).
- **Store:** `AccessReviewStore` (`server/core/src/access_review_store.{hpp,cpp}`,
  schema `access_review_store`) — born-on-Postgres (ADR-0006), two tables
  (`access_review_campaign`, `access_review_attestation`), authoritative/
  fail-hard posture (ADR-0012 §1).
- **RBAC:** new `AuditLog:Attest` operation on the existing `AuditLog`
  securable, granted only to `Administrator` and a new seeded `Reviewer`
  role (`AuditLog:Read` + `AuditLog:Attest` only — 7 built-in roles total).
- **MCP twins:** `export_access_review`, `open_access_review`,
  `record_attestation`, `get_access_review`, `list_access_reviews`
  (hardening round), `close_access_review` (hardening round) — JSON only;
  the REST `?format=csv` export has no MCP equivalent.
  `record_attestation` carries `destructiveHint:true` (hardening round —
  it is a decision-overwriting UPSERT); every other twin is
  `destructiveHint:false`.
- **Audit actions:** `access_review.exported`, `.list` (hardening round),
  `.campaign_opened`, `.attested`, `.flagged`, `.closed`, `.get`.
- **Metrics (hardening round):** `yuzu_access_review_export_total{format}`,
  `yuzu_access_review_export_duration_seconds`,
  `yuzu_access_review_campaigns_opened_total`,
  `yuzu_access_review_attestations_total{decision}` — see "Metrics" below.

## Control / authz decision

### CC6.2 control mapping

- **`GET /api/v1/access-reviews/export`** is the **"role-assignment
  export"** half of CC6.2 — a point-in-time list of who has what access,
  pullable on demand for a spot-check or an offline CSV hand-off to an
  auditor. It is intentionally stateless: nothing is persisted by calling
  it, so pulling it repeatedly (e.g. to sanity-check a campaign before
  opening one) carries no side effect beyond its own audit row.
- **The attestation campaign** (`open_campaign` → `record_attestation` →
  `close_campaign`) is the **"manager/security sign-off"** half — the
  auditable proof that a *human* reviewer looked at each grant and made an
  explicit decision, not just that a list was generated. `pending_count` on
  a closed campaign is the "how complete was this review" number an
  auditor needs without re-deriving it from the attestation rows.
- Read together, the two pieces answer CC6.2's actual question: not just
  "what access exists" (the export alone) but "was it *reviewed*, by whom,
  when, and what did they decide" (the campaign).

**Why `access_review.*` is deliberately NOT in the `auth-sample` export
scope.** `GET /api/v1/audit/auth-sample` (`rest_api_v1.cpp`) samples audit
rows with `action_prefixes = {"auth.", "mfa.", "session.",
"engine_principal."}` — `access_review.*` is not, and should not be, added
to that list. `auth-sample` is CC7.2 evidence — a sampled proof that
*authentication* activity (logins, MFA challenges, session lifecycle,
engine-credential events) is being logged and monitored for anomalies; a
*sample* is the right shape for a high-volume, per-request event stream.
Access review is CC6.2 evidence with the opposite shape: a low-volume,
high-value, individually-consequential record (who reviewed what, and
decided what) that must be read **completely**, never sampled — a reviewer
or auditor needs every attestation on a campaign, not a pseudo-random
subset. It has its own dedicated, complete-by-construction export (`GET
/api/v1/access-reviews/export` and the campaign lifecycle), which is the
correct-shaped evidence surface for its own control, not a candidate for
folding into a sibling control's sampled stream.

### #2225 — global `AuditLog:Read`/`AuditLog:Attest` gate, not `authorize_list_read`

Every new list/fan-out read of **per-agent** data must use the ADR-0017
`authorize_list_read` admit-then-filter chokepoint (World A) — never a bare
global `require_permission`. This feature is a list read, and deliberately
does **not** use that chokepoint. This is a considered exception, not an
oversight, for three reasons:

1. **There is no per-agent boundary to filter against.** RBAC role
   assignments are fleet-wide facts about a *principal* (a user, a group, an
   engine principal), not facts scoped to a device or management group. The
   ADR-0017 gate exists specifically to stop a confined operator from seeing
   agents outside their groups; a role grant has no analogous "which
   management group is this grant in" dimension.
2. **A confinement-filtered slice would be worthless as evidence.** Even a
   contrived per-operator filter (e.g. "only show grants for principals who
   touch my devices") would produce a partial certification — and a partial
   certification is not a certification. An auditor signing off on CC6.2
   compliance needs the *complete* grant population, every time.
3. **The privileged surface is the gate itself, not a filter on top of it.**
   `AuditLog:Read`/`AuditLog:Attest` are already RBAC-privileged operations
   — nobody gets them by default. Requiring them (global, unconfined) for
   this feature is the same posture the shipped `GET
   /api/v1/audit/auth-sample` sibling already uses, and for the same reason:
   a dedicated read-only auditor/reviewer principal can be granted evidence
   access **without** also granting full `Administrator` authority
   (separation of duties) — a *stronger* CC6.3 least-privilege posture than
   folding this into `require_admin`, not a weaker one.

The seeded `Reviewer` role operationalizes this: `AuditLog:Read` +
`AuditLog:Attest`, nothing else — no `Write`/`Delete`/`Approve`/`Push` on
`AuditLog`, and none of the write access `Administrator` carries elsewhere.
An organization appoints a reviewer without handing them the keys to the
platform.

### PII judgment — `last_activity_ms`/`last_activity_kind` are NOT behavioral-PII-tier

The device-pages / DEX / TAR routed concern (see `docs/user-manual/
device-management.md` and `CLAUDE.md`'s "Device pages" row) establishes that
**behavioral-PII** access — per-device DEX signals, process trees, TAR
capture data — must funnel through `server/core/src/rest_audit.hpp`'s
`emit_behavioral_audit` chokepoint (REST fail-closed 503 + `Sec-Audit-Failed`
on an audit-persist failure; dashboard/MCP set-and-proceed). This feature's
`last_activity_ms`/`last_activity_kind` fields (a user's `AuthDB` last-login
epoch, or an engine principal's most recent credential `last_used_at`)
deliberately do **not** route through that funnel. This is a considered
classification decision, not an oversight:

- **What `emit_behavioral_audit` protects is fine-grained, per-signal
  behavioral telemetry** — which processes ran, which DEX observation types
  fired, which files/services were touched, on which specific device, at
  what granularity. That is data about what an *endpoint* (and by
  extension, potentially, the human using it) was *doing*.
- **`last_activity_ms`/`last_activity_kind` are a single coarse admin-
  activity timestamp per principal** — "when did this account last
  authenticate" or "when was this credential last used" — already visible
  to any `AuditLog:Read` holder via the ordinary audit log (`GET
  /api/v1/audit`) and the `auth-sample` export. It carries no per-device,
  per-process, or per-signal granularity; it is exactly the kind of coarse
  account-hygiene fact CC6.2/CC6.3 evidence is built from, not a new
  disclosure surface.
- **The existing gate is the correct-strength control for this data
  class.** These fields ride the SAME `AuditLog:Read` permission check that
  gates every other field on this row (roles, `effective_permission_count`,
  `classification`, `lifecycle_state`), and the export is self-audited
  (`access_review.exported`) exactly like the sibling `auth-sample` export.
  Layering the stricter fail-closed-503 behavioral-PII posture on top would
  be a mismatch of control strength to data sensitivity — and would make a
  transient audit-persist hiccup block a compliance export outright, which
  is the wrong failure mode for *this* surface (see "fail-loud on the read,
  set-and-proceed on the audit" below).
- **If a future field on this export ever gains per-device or per-signal
  granularity** (e.g. a per-device last-command-executed timestamp), that
  field would need to be re-evaluated against this same test and likely
  migrated to `emit_behavioral_audit` — this judgment is scoped to the two
  fields as they exist today, not a blanket exemption for the route.

### flag ≠ revoke — the enforcement boundary

`record_attestation`'s `decision:"flagged_revoke"` is **evidence only**. No
code path from this route calls `RbacStore::unassign_role`,
`EnginePrincipalStore::revoke`, or any other authorization-mutating
function — `AccessReviewStore::record_attestation` writes exactly one row
(`decision`, `reviewer`, `justification`, `decided_at_ms`) to
`access_review_attestation` and nothing else. This is deliberate, for two
reasons:

1. **A reviewer flagging a grant and an operator revoking it are different
   trust decisions with different blast radii.** A reviewer's job is to
   surface a *recommendation* ("I believe this access should be removed");
   actually removing it is a live authorization change that can break a
   dependent workflow or lock out a legitimate user, and belongs on the
   ordinary, individually-audited RBAC/engine-principal write surface
   (`unassign_role`, `revoke_certificate`, etc.), gated by *its own*
   permission (`Security:Write`/`Delete`, not `AuditLog:Attest`).
2. **Auto-revoking on a flag would make `AuditLog:Attest` a second, less-
   audited path to a real authorization change** — exactly the kind of
   confused-deputy shortcut the access-review surface must not become.
   Keeping flag and revoke on separate, separately-gated routes means the
   audit trail for an actual revocation always carries the permission and
   audit verb appropriate to *that* mutation, with the flag serving only as
   the recorded rationale an operator can point back to.

The two outcomes (`access_review.attested` vs `access_review.flagged`) are
separately-named audit verbs specifically so a SIEM rule (or a human
reviewing the log) can count/alert on flagged-for-revocation grants without
parsing a `decision` field out of a generic verb.

### Retention posture — born-on-PG, deliberately no prune

`AccessReviewStore` carries **no prune method**, unlike the `/auto` pre-
flight/deployment runs (`PreflightRunStore`/`DeploymentRunStore`), which are
operational scratch state pruned at 14 days. A **closed** access-review
campaign *is* the compliance evidence this feature exists to produce — it
persists indefinitely by default. This is intentional, not an unfinished
feature:

- Retaining every campaign forever is the conservative default for
  evidence a SOC 2 auditor may ask to see years later.
- Any future retention policy (e.g. a configurable retention floor tied to
  an auditor's actual evidence-window requirement) is an **explicit,
  separately-reviewed decision** — it must not be inherited by copying a
  prune cadence from an unrelated operational store.
- Construction is fail-**closed** per ADR-0012 §1 (matching
  `EnginePrincipalStore`, not the durability-on-top `PreflightRunStore`
  posture): a reachable database whose schema can't migrate refuses to
  start (`startup_failed_`), because a degraded evidence store serving
  partial writes is worse than the server refusing to boot.

### Fail-loud on the read, evidence-of-access on the write

- **`build_access_review` fails the WHOLE export on the first read error**
  (R1) — never a partial `vector<AccessReviewRow>`. A compliance export
  that silently drops rows on a transient failure is worse than one that
  fails loudly: an incomplete-but-200 export reads as "this is the complete
  list" when the truth is "the read partially failed" — a false negative in
  exactly the evidence this feature exists to produce. The REST route maps
  a `build_access_review` failure to `503`, never a 200 with fewer rows.
- **The export's own access is itself audited** (`access_review.exported`)
  so pulling evidence stays on the audit chain — mirroring
  `audit.auth_sample.exported`. Emission is best-effort: if the audit row
  fails to persist, the export still returns its data (evidence access
  should not be blocked by an audit-store hiccup), but the failure is made
  **visible** via a `Sec-Audit-Failed: true` response header rather than
  silently swallowed.

### Metrics (hardening round)

The feature previously carried zero metrics — an `sre` governance SHOULD.
Four bounded-label Prometheus series, wired in the REST handlers only (the
MCP twins are not double-counted), pre-seeded per
`docs/observability-conventions.md` so `absent()` alerts stay meaningful:

- `yuzu_access_review_export_total{format}` (counter, `format` ∈ {`json`,
  `csv`}) — exports pulled via `GET /api/v1/access-reviews/export`.
- `yuzu_access_review_export_duration_seconds` (histogram) — latency of the
  cross-principal grant-population read (`build_access_review`) behind the
  export.
- `yuzu_access_review_campaigns_opened_total` (counter) — campaigns opened
  via `POST /api/v1/access-reviews`.
- `yuzu_access_review_attestations_total{decision}` (counter, `decision` ∈
  {`attested`, `flagged_revoke`}) — reviewer decisions recorded via `POST
  /api/v1/access-reviews/{id}/attestations`.

See `docs/user-manual/metrics.md` → "Access review metrics" for the full
reference.

## Hard-invariant check

- Export is a `std::expected`-propagating read across `AuthDB`, `RbacStore`,
  and `EnginePrincipalStore` (required) plus optional `ApiTokenStore`/
  `DirectorySync` enrichment — first failure fails the whole call, never a
  partial result. ✅
- `AccessReviewStore` construction fail-closed (ADR-0012 §1); every
  mutator/completeness-reader returns a typed `std::expected`, never a
  silently-empty/no-op result. ✅
- `open_campaign` freezes the campaign row + every `pending` attestation row
  in **one transaction** — no partially-frozen campaign is observable. ✅
- `record_attestation`/`get_campaign`/`close_campaign` use a
  machine-checkable `"not_found: "` error prefix, mapped to `404`
  (REST)/`kInvalidParams` (MCP) distinctly from a genuine `503`/
  `kInternalError` store failure — a caller can tell "bad id" from
  "transient outage" without string-matching a human-readable message. ✅
- `record_attestation` never calls any RBAC/`EnginePrincipalStore` mutating
  function — grepped `access_review_store.cpp` for `unassign`/`revoke`/
  `delete_role` call sites: none. ✅
- Every route requires `AuditLog:Read` or `AuditLog:Attest`, and **every
  route — reads included — additionally runs `deny_engine_session`**: an
  engine-classed caller is structurally denied on every access-review
  route, not just the mutating ones, matching the engine-principal
  surface's own posture. ✅
- A2 discovery: all six routes (export, list, campaign-open, campaign-get,
  attestations, close) are enumerable in `GET /api/v1/openapi.json`. ✅
- **Grant-table-driven completeness (UP-1, hardening round).**
  `build_access_review` walks the grant table (`RbacStore::
  list_all_principal_roles_checked()`) directly rather than the three
  principal rosters — a principal holding a live grant always produces a
  row, even when no roster recognizes its `principal_id` (a since-deleted
  user, a stale IdP row, an OIDC/SSO principal minted outside every
  roster). Such a row is surfaced as `source="orphan"`,
  `lifecycle_state="unknown"` rather than silently dropped. This closes a
  real completeness gap the original roster-walk design had: a grant
  belonging to a principal outside every roster was previously invisible
  to the export — a false negative in exactly the evidence this feature
  exists to produce. ✅
- **CSV formula-injection neutralization (hardening round, CWE-1236).**
  `to_csv` prefixes any field whose first byte is `=`/`+`/`-`/`@`/tab/CR
  with a literal `'` before the RFC-4180 quoting pass. Several exported
  fields (principal id, display name, owner/email, role names) are
  influenceable by an external identity provider (SCIM `userName`, an
  engine principal's `display_name`), so this closes a genuine
  spreadsheet-formula-execution risk on the CSV export path, not a
  theoretical one. ✅

## Tests

- `access_review_model.hpp`/`.cpp` — pure read-model, unit-testable without
  a live server; covers the fail-on-first-error contract (R1) and the
  per-principal-type direct-grant computation (R2), including the
  deliberate group-vs-user divergence from `get_effective_permissions`.
- `access_review_store.hpp`/`.cpp` — freeze-at-open atomicity (R3),
  `not_found:`-prefixed error contract, idempotent-rejecting `close_campaign`.
- REST route tests cover the `400`/`403`/`404`/`503` matrix per route,
  `Sec-Audit-Failed` on a dropped export audit row, and the CSV
  `Content-Disposition` header.
- MCP tool tests cover the tier/RBAC gate, the `not_found:` → `kInvalidParams`
  mapping, and tool annotation shape (`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`).

## Residual / follow-ups

- **User `last_activity_kind` is `"n/a"` for every row today.** `AuthDB` has
  no read accessor for a user's last-login timestamp yet — a noted,
  tracked follow-up, not a silently-shipped gap. Once added, the export
  should switch `last_activity_kind` to `"last_login"` for user rows the
  same way it already reports `"last_used"` for engine rows.
- **User rows show direct grants only.** Group-inherited access is not
  flattened onto the user's row; it is visible on the group's own row. A
  future "resolved effective access" column is a candidate follow-up but
  would need a new reverse group-membership bulk accessor `RbacStore` does
  not currently expose.
- **`source="scim"` is forward-compat, not yet populated** by any SCIM
  write path — reserved so the field does not need a schema/API change once
  SCIM-provisioned-user provenance is threaded through.
- ~~**No campaign-list endpoint.**~~ **CLOSED (hardening round).** `GET
  /api/v1/access-reviews` now lists every campaign's metadata, newest-first,
  capped at 500, with an MCP twin `list_access_reviews`.
- **No retention/archival policy beyond "keep forever."** `AccessReviewStore`
  deliberately carries no prune method (see "Retention posture" above); a
  future configurable retention floor tied to an auditor's actual
  evidence-window requirement is an explicit, separately-reviewed decision,
  not something this feature should default to.
- **No rate limit on the export route.** `GET /api/v1/access-reviews/export`
  has no request-rate cap of its own beyond the standard `AuditLog:Read`
  gate — a low-risk gap today (the route is admin/auditor-scoped and O(grant
  count) per call, not O(fleet size)), but worth a shared rate-limit
  primitive if/when one exists for other admin-read routes.
- **No "effective access per user" view.** The export is per-`(principal,
  role)`; there is no single call that resolves one user's fully-flattened
  effective access (direct grants + group-inherited grants) in one row —
  see the "user rows show direct grants only" item above.
- **`AuthDB` has no user last-login read accessor** (see the
  `last_activity_kind="n/a"` item above) — a shared prerequisite for both
  this export and a future user-activity dashboard.
- **No scheduled/recurring campaigns.** Opening a campaign is a manual,
  on-demand `POST /api/v1/access-reviews` call — there is no cron-style
  "open a new campaign automatically every quarter" primitive. An operator
  or an external scheduler (e.g. a cron'd `open_access_review` MCP call)
  must drive the cadence today.
