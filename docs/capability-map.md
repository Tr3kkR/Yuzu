# Yuzu Capability Map

**Version:** 4.0 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Status:** v4.0 partial re-baseline against dev @ d295db964 (see Method)

---

## How to Read This Document

Each capability is rated on two axes:

**Implementation Status**
| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|:----:|--------|---------|
| :white_check_mark: | **Done** | Implemented and functional |
| :large_orange_diamond: | **Partial** | Some coverage exists; gaps remain |
| :x: | **Not Started** | No implementation yet |

**Delivery Tier**
| Tier | Label | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| **T1** | Foundation | Core capabilities for a viable endpoint management platform |
| **T2** | Advanced | Enterprise-grade features for production deployments at scale |
| **T3** | Future | Aspirational capabilities for competitive parity with top-tier platforms |

---

## Progress at a Glance

> **Method (reproduce this before trusting the number).** Every figure below is a direct
> tally of the per-entry status icons in the 39 domains that follow — no entry is counted
> outside its own domain, and each entry counts once against its `T1`/`T2`/`T3` tier label.
> Reproduce with:
> `awk '/^### [0-9]+\.[0-9]+/ { if ($0 ~ /:white_check_mark:/) d++; else if ($0 ~ /:large_orange_diamond:/) p++; else if ($0 ~ /:x:/) n++ } END { print d, p, n, d+p+n }' docs/capability-map.md`
> → `206 20 39 265`. Tier tallies (`Foundation`=T1, `Advanced`=T2, `Future`=T3) add the same
> awk pattern filtered on `` `T1` ``/`` `T2` ``/`` `T3` ``. The former "New (Ph 8-16)" interim
> row is retired — those phases are now ordinary domains 25-31, and 2026 additions land as
> domains 32-39 rather than an undifferentiated bucket. **Domains 32-39 were verified for
> file presence and meson-build compilation only** (grep/`ls`/`meson.build` census, 2026-09-07);
> their per-row behavioural claims (exact signal counts, retention windows, etc.) are inherited
> from the unmerged 2026-07 capability-industry review rather than independently re-derived
> this session — honest scoping over implied uniform depth. Domains 1-31's regraded rows each
> carry their own inline evidence citation and verification date. **Rows regraded or added on
> 2026-09-07 carry the marker `*(verified 2026-09-07)*`; all other rows carry their v3.0
> (2026-03-30) grade unchanged and were NOT re-verified in this pass** — reproduce with
> `grep -c '\*(verified 2026-09-07)\*' docs/capability-map.md` → `60` (58 `###` rows across
> §14, §18, §20-22, §24, §26-28, §30-31, all of §32-39, plus one Appendix A caption note, plus
> this sentence's own citation of the literal marker string). Of the 265 total rows, 207
> (265 - 58) are un-regraded v3.0 carry-overs — this document does NOT represent
> whole-document verification against dev @ d295db964, only the 58 marked rows do.
> Four hand-maintained views
> must be updated together whenever a row's icon or tier changes: the headline/tier bars below,
> the per-domain summary table, Appendix A's plugin count, and Appendix B's Foundation tally —
> nothing in `tests/` or CI checks them against the awk yet (tracked as a governance follow-up).

> **Scaffolded vs production-quality.** The percentages above measure feature presence, not enterprise hardening. "Done" means "implemented and functional" — not "hardened, observable, and proven at large-fleet scale" on every domain. Known gaps at the §-level (e.g. configurable heartbeat in §1.2, unified diagnostics bundle in §1.3, runtime plugin install in §1.5) remain even where a domain is marked Done. The `docs/capability-agentic-audit-2026-05.md` audit (figures as of 2026-05 — its counts predate this v4.0 tally) is the source for the production-quality dimension; subsequent reviews should keep it current.

---

## 1. Agent Lifecycle Management

*Agent registration, health monitoring, self-diagnostics, and remote control.*

### 1.1 Agent Registration and Enrollment :white_check_mark: `T1`

3-tier enrollment model: manual approval (Tier 1), pre-shared tokens (Tier 2), and platform trust (Tier 3, reserved). gRPC `Register` RPC with enrollment token support.

> **Gap:** Tier 3 server-side certificate validation not implemented.

### 1.2 Heartbeat and Session Keepalive :white_check_mark: `T1`

`Heartbeat` RPC with pending command delivery and `status_tags` for lightweight state reporting.

> **Gap:** No configurable heartbeat interval from server side.

### 1.3 Agent Summary and Diagnostics :white_check_mark: `T1`

`diagnostics` and `status` plugins report agent health, uptime, and resource usage. `agent_actions` plugin for self-management.

> **Gap:** No unified diagnostics bundle download (key files, logs).

### 1.4 Agent Version and Update Management :white_check_mark: `T1`

`CheckForUpdate`/`DownloadUpdate` RPCs in agent.proto. Full updater implementation (`agents/core/src/updater.cpp`) with hash verification and platform-specific self-update.

### 1.5 Agent Extensibility Introspection :white_check_mark: `T1`

Plugins reported in `RegisterRequest.AgentInfo.plugins` with name, version, description, and capabilities list.

> **Gap:** No runtime plugin install/uninstall from server.

### 1.6 Agent Sleep and Stagger Control :white_check_mark: `T2`

Stagger control via `CommandRequest.stagger` field. Agents introduce random delay before executing, preventing thundering herd on broadcast.

### 1.7 Agent Logging and Log Retrieval :white_check_mark: `T2`

spdlog-based local logging on the agent. `agent_logging` plugin provides remote log retrieval (`get_log` action, configurable 1-500 lines) and key file listing (`get_key_files` action). Log file discovery from agent config with platform default fallbacks.

### 1.8 Connection and Session Info :white_check_mark: `T1`

Session ID returned on registration. `WatchEvents` tracks connect/disconnect events. `connection_info` action in diagnostics plugin reports server address, TLS status, session ID, gRPC channel state, reconnect count, latency, uptime.

### 1.9 Instruction Execution Statistics :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ExecutionTracker` (ADR-0065: migrated to PostgreSQL, schema `execution_tracker`) aggregation methods: per-agent stats, per-definition stats, fleet summary. REST endpoints: `GET /api/v1/execution-statistics`, `/agents`, `/definitions`. HTMX fragment for dashboard card.

---

## 2. Command Execution and Orchestration

*Dispatching instructions to agents, collecting results, and workflow coordination.*

### 2.1 Single-Agent Command Dispatch :white_check_mark: `T1`

`ExecuteCommand` RPC with streaming response. `SendCommand` in the management API.

### 2.2 Multi-Agent Broadcast :white_check_mark: `T1`

`SendCommandRequest.agent_ids` supports broadcast (empty = all agents). Scope/filter targeting is also supported: `AgentRegistry::evaluate_scope` (`server/core/src/agent_registry.cpp:820-861`) instantiates an `AttributeResolver` lambda that resolves `ostype`, `hostname`, `arch`, `agent_version`, `tag:X` (in-memory `scopable_tags` plus persistent `TagStore` fallback), and `props.X` (custom properties), composed via the scope DSL's `AND` / `OR` / `NOT`. See `docs/asset-tagging-guide.md` and `docs/scope-walking-design.md` for operator-level usage.

### 2.3 Streaming Command Output :white_check_mark: `T1`

`CommandResponse` streams via gRPC and SSE to the dashboard.

### 2.4 Command Timeout and Expiry :white_check_mark: `T1`

`CommandRequest.expires_at` and `SendCommandRequest.timeout_seconds`.

> **Gap:** No server-side command cancellation mid-execution.

### 2.5 Bidirectional Command Channel :white_check_mark: `T1`

`Subscribe` bidi-streaming RPC as alternative to polling.

### 2.6 Instruction Templates / Definitions :white_check_mark: `T2`

`InstructionStore` with full CRUD. Named, versioned definitions with YAML source, parameter schema (JSON Schema), result schema (typed columns), approval mode, concurrency mode, platform constraints. JSON import/export. Stored in SQLite.

### 2.7 Instruction Sets (Grouping) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`InstructionSet` CRUD in `InstructionStore`. Named logical groupings with cascade delete. Definitions belong to at most one set. RBAC permissions scoped at set level.

### 2.8 Instruction Hierarchies (Workflows) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ExecutionTracker` supports parent/child execution hierarchy via `parent_execution_id`. Query children by parent. Follow-up instructions use parent response data as scope input.

### 2.9 Instruction Scheduling :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ScheduleEngine` (ADR-0065: migrated to PostgreSQL, schema `schedule_engine`) with frequency types (daily, weekly, monthly, sub-day), scope expressions evaluated dynamically at dispatch, enable/disable toggle, execution history tracking. REST CRUD via `/api/schedules`.

### 2.10 Instruction Approval Workflows :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ApprovalManager` (ADR-0065: migrated to PostgreSQL, schema `approval_manager`) with submit/approve/reject, ownership validation (reviewer != submitter), pending count, scope expression, and full audit trail. Per-definition approval mode (auto/role-gated/always).

### 2.11 Target Estimation :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ScopeEngine` with `/api/scope/estimate` endpoint. Evaluates scope expression against connected agents and returns matching count and agent list before execution.

### 2.12 Instruction Progress Tracking :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ExecutionTracker` with per-agent status tracking (dispatched, responded, success, failure), aggregate progress percentage, summary with agent state counts. Dashboard progress bars via REST API.

### 2.13 Instruction Rerun and Cancellation :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ExecutionTracker` supports rerun (clone with same parameters, optional failed-only targeting) and cancellation with user attribution. REST endpoints: `POST /api/executions/{id}/rerun`, `POST /api/executions/{id}/cancel`.

---

## 3. Device and Endpoint Information

*Hardware, OS, identity, and classification data from managed endpoints.*

### 3.1 OS Summary :white_check_mark: `T1`

`os_info` plugin (cross-platform). Platform reported in registration.

### 3.2 Hardware Inventory :white_check_mark: `T1`

`hardware` plugin (cross-platform) covers CPU, RAM, and disks.

### 3.3 Device Identity :white_check_mark: `T1`

`device_identity` plugin. `agent_id` (UUID) in protocol.

> **Gap:** No FQDN-based server-side lookup.

### 3.4 Disk Information :white_check_mark: `T1`

Covered by the `hardware` plugin.

### 3.5 Processor Details :white_check_mark: `T1`

Covered by the `hardware` plugin.

### 3.6 Device Criticality Classification :white_check_mark: `T2`

Implemented as a special-purpose tag via the device tagging system (`TagStore`). Set/get criticality per device using key-value tags.

### 3.7 Device Location Tracking :white_check_mark: `T2`

Implemented as a special-purpose tag via the device tagging system (`TagStore`). Set/get location per device using key-value tags.

### 3.8 Mapped Drive History :large_orange_diamond: `T3`

`mapdrive` TAR capture source (`agents/plugins/tar/src/tar_mapdrive_collector.cpp`). Tracks network-share mappings in **both** directions — outbound (drives this host maps to remote shares) and inbound (remote hosts mapping this host's shares, the lateral-movement signal) — via a `direction` column. A one-time init backfill seeds **historical** mappings (`origin='historical'`) from persistent artifacts; the periodic `collect_slow` leg snapshot-diffs current state (`appeared`/`removed`). Windows: outbound `WNetEnumResourceW`; outbound history from registry `Network`/MRU/`MountPoints2` across offline profiles; inbound `NetSessionEnum` (needs local-admin/Server-Operator); inbound history from Security event log 4624/4634. Linux: outbound `/proc/mounts` + `/etc/fstab`; inbound `smbstatus` + Samba logs. Opt-in (`mapdrive_enabled`, default off) — rows carry usernames + share paths. Queryable via `$MapDrive_Live`.

> **Gap:** macOS is `kPlanned` (returns empty). Linux inbound requires Samba installed; Windows inbound-history over-captures (all type-3 network logons, not only SMB).

### 3.9 Printer Inventory :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Enumerate connected printers for asset tracking.

### 3.10 Device Tagging (Key-Value Metadata) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`TagStore` on the PostgreSQL substrate (ADR-0050, schema `tag_store`). Full CRUD: set, get, get_all, delete, check, clear, count. Agent-side `tags` plugin with server-side sync on Register. Validation: key max 64 chars, value max 448 bytes. `agents_with_tag()` for scope queries; typed degrade-distinguishable reads (a store failure never reads as "no tags").

---

## 4. Network Information and Discovery

*Network configuration, connection state, and active discovery.*

### 4.1 IP Address and Interface Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`network_config` plugin (cross-platform).

### 4.2 TCP Connection Listing :white_check_mark: `T1`

`netstat` plugin (cross-platform).

### 4.3 Listening Endpoint Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`netstat` plugin (`netstat_list` action; `attribution` adds owning-process
resolution -- folded from the retired sockwho plugin, #3403).

### 4.4 ARP Table :white_check_mark: `T1`

`network_config` plugin.

### 4.5 DNS Cache Retrieval :white_check_mark: `T1`

`network_actions` plugin has flush DNS. `dns_cache` action in `network_config` plugin dumps DNS cache (Windows: `DnsGetCacheDataTable` via dnsapi.dll, Linux: systemd-resolved query).

### 4.6 WiFi Network Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`wifi` plugin (cross-platform). `list_networks` scans for visible WiFi networks with SSID, signal strength, security type, channel, and BSSID. `connected` reports the currently connected network. Windows: WlanAPI, Linux: NetworkManager D-Bus (nmcli fallback). macOS: `connected` uses CoreWLAN (`wifi_corewlan.mm`); `list_networks` uses legacy `airport -s`/`system_profiler`. On macOS 14+, Location Services withholds SSID/BSSID from a background daemon, reported as `<ssid-withheld>` on an otherwise-live connection.

### 4.7 Wake-on-LAN :white_check_mark: `T2`

`wol` plugin (cross-platform). `wake` sends magic packet (UDP broadcast, 6×0xFF + 16×MAC) to a target MAC address. `check` verifies reachability natively — unprivileged ICMP echo (`IcmpSendEcho` on Windows, an unprivileged ICMP socket on Linux/macOS) with a TCP-connect fallback on port 443 for hosts/kernels that drop or deny ICMP (Wave 2, ADR-3002) — no subprocess spawn on any platform.

### 4.8 Network Diagnostics :white_check_mark: `T1`

`network_diag` plugin (cross-platform). `network_actions` for ping.

### 4.9 NetBIOS / Name Lookup :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Legacy reverse lookup on IP addresses.

### 4.10 ARP Scanning (Subnet Discovery) :white_check_mark: `T3`

`discovery` plugin with `scan_subnet` action. ARP scan + ping sweep of a CIDR subnet to find hosts. Returns IP, MAC address, hostname, and managed/unmanaged status. Cross-platform: native ARP-table acquisition (`GetIpNetTable2` on Windows, `/proc/net/arp` on Linux, the routing-socket `sysctl` on macOS) + an unprivileged ICMP ping sweep — no subprocess spawn on any platform (Wave 2, ADR-3002). Input validation prevents command injection on CIDR parameter.

### 4.11 Port Scanning :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Probe specified ports on target devices for service discovery.

---

## 5. Process and Service Management

*Enumerate, inspect, and control running processes and system services.*

### 5.1 Process Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`processes` plugin (cross-platform). `procfetch` for formatted view with executable hash.

### 5.2 Process Termination :white_check_mark: `T1`

`processes` plugin supports kill.

> **Gap:** No multi-process kill by pattern or batch.

### 5.3 Service Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`services` plugin (cross-platform).

### 5.4 Service Control :white_check_mark: `T1`

`services` plugin supports start/stop/restart.

### 5.5 Open Windows Enumeration :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Desktop interaction to enumerate visible application windows.

---

## 6. User and Session Management

*Enumerate users, sessions, and group membership on managed endpoints.*

### 6.1 Logged-On User Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`users` plugin (cross-platform).

### 6.2 Primary User Determination :white_check_mark: `T2`

`users` plugin `primary_user` action. Identifies primary user via most-frequent-login heuristic. Linux: parses `last` output. macOS: parses `last` output. Windows: queries Event Log 4624 logon events, falls back to registry ProfileList.

### 6.3 Local Group Membership :white_check_mark: `T2`

`users` plugin `local_admins` action lists Administrators group members. `group_members` action enumerates members of any specified local group. Linux: parses `/etc/group` + checks sudo/wheel. Windows: NetLocalGroupGetMembers API. macOS: dscl.

### 6.4 User Connection History :white_check_mark: `T2`

`users` plugin `session_history` action. Historical login/logout records with configurable count (default 50). Cross-platform: parses `last` (Linux/macOS), Windows Event Log logon/logoff events.

### 6.5 Active Session Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`users` plugin `sessions` action. Lists active interactive sessions (console, RDP, SSH) with user, session type, login time, and state. Cross-platform.

---

## 7. Software and Application Management

*Inventory installed software, manage installations, and control applications.*

### 7.1 Installed Application Inventory :white_check_mark: `T1`

`installed_apps` plugin (cross-platform).

### 7.2 Windows Installer (MSI) Package Inventory :white_check_mark: `T1`

`msi_packages` plugin (Windows MSI / macOS pkgutil).

### 7.3 SCCM Integration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`sccm` plugin (Windows).

### 7.4 Software Uninstall :white_check_mark: `T2`

`software_actions` plugin.

### 7.5 Per-User Application Inventory :white_check_mark: `T2`

`installed_apps` plugin extended with per-user hive enumeration (`list_per_user`): each local profile's `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` is read from the live `HKEY_USERS\<SID>` hive when the user is logged in, falling back to an offline `NTUSER.DAT` mount otherwise — via the shared ladder in `agents/shared/win_profiles.hpp` (#2771), not a literal `HKCU` read (which under the agent's system-context identity resolves to the service account's own profile, not an end user's — see §12.7). Distinguishes system-wide from user-specific installs in output; on Linux/macOS `list_per_user` reports system-scope packages/apps plus (macOS) the calling account's own Homebrew formulae, not a per-profile walk.

### 7.6 Software Deployment (Install/Upgrade) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`SoftwareDeploymentStore` (PostgreSQL, ADR-0051) with package registration, deployment lifecycle (staged/deploying/verifying/completed/cancelled/rolled_back/failed), per-agent status tracking. REST endpoints: `GET/POST /api/v1/software-packages`, `GET/POST /api/v1/software-deployments`, `/start`, `/rollback`, `/cancel`. **Dormant** (same family as `LicenseStore`/ADR-0048) — the store is migrated and tested but not constructed by the server, so these routes do not register today.

---

## 8. Patch and Update Management

*Detect, deploy, and track operating system and application patches.*

### 8.1 Installed Update Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`windows_updates` plugin with `installed` action. Cross-platform: Windows (bounded WMI `Win32_QuickFixEngineering` query, capped at 512 rows, unsorted — WQL has no `ORDER BY` for a data-class query, a disclosed behaviour change from the retired PowerShell path's 50-most-recent-sorted output), Linux (rpm/apt), macOS (system_profiler).

### 8.2 Pending Reboot Detection :white_check_mark: `T1`

`windows_updates` plugin `pending_reboot` action. Cross-platform reboot-pending detection:
Windows (3 registry keys: WindowsUpdate RebootRequired, CBS RebootPending, Session Manager PendingFileRenameOperations),
Linux (reboot-required file + kernel version comparison + needs-restarting fallback),
macOS (softwareupdate restart flag, bounded to a 60s deadline — replaces the plugin's
own prior unbounded `popen()` call, which could hang indefinitely on a headless/offline
Mac). Reports per-source status and aggregate boolean.

### 8.3 Patch Deployment :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

`PatchManager::deploy_patch()` (Postgres-backed, ADR-0062) creates a deployment record + a
`pending` per-target row for a KB across one or more agents; `get_deployment()`/
`list_deployments()`/`cancel_deployment()` and REST endpoints for the same. **The scan →
download → install → verify → reboot orchestration workflow itself has no server-side
implementation** — it existed as `PatchManager::execute_deployment()` but had zero production
callers (nothing ever wired a dispatch/OS-lookup callback to it) and was deleted rather than
ported in the store's Postgres migration; see #3669 for the removed tested-but-unwired
implementation. A target's status only advances past `pending` via a direct
`update_target_status()` call, which nothing in this codebase makes today. *(Re-verified
2026-09-07 for the v4.0 baseline: `execute_deployment()` remains absent from
`server/core/src/patch_manager.{hpp,cpp}`; grade unchanged.)*

### 8.4 Patch Status Tracking :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

`PatchManager` tracks per-device deployment status via `PatchDeploymentTarget` — per-agent
status, error message, start/complete timestamps, settable via `update_target_status()` and
queryable via `get_deployment()`/REST. **Deployment-level aggregate counters
(`completed_targets`/`failed_targets`) are set once at creation and never recalculated
afterward** — the only caller of the former `recalculate_deployment_progress()` was
`execute_deployment()` (§8.3), deleted alongside it.

### 8.5 Patch Metadata Retrieval :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

`PatchInfo` stores KB ID, title, severity (Critical/Important/Moderate/Low/Unspecified), release
date, and scan timestamp. `get_fleet_patch_summary()` returns per-KB missing counts.
`get_missing_patches()` and `get_installed_patches()` support severity and agent filtering — all
correctly implemented, but **`record_patches()`, the only method that writes `patch_inventory`,
has no production caller** (verified by grep — pre-existing, predates the Postgres migration),
so every one of these reads returns empty in any real deployment today. See #3676.

### 8.6 Reboot Management (Post-Patch) :x: `T2`

Reboot orchestration (`PatchManager::execute_deployment()`: pre-reboot `device.interaction.notify`
best-effort user notice, then a cross-platform reboot command — Windows `shutdown /r /t N /c`,
Linux/macOS `shutdown -r +N`) existed but had zero production callers and was removed in the
store's Postgres migration (ADR-0062); see #3669 for the removed tested-but-unwired
implementation. `reboot_delay_seconds`/`reboot_at` are still accepted by
`POST /api/patches/deploy`, clamped, and stored on `PatchDeployment`, but nothing currently acts
on them. *(Re-verified 2026-09-07 for the v4.0 baseline: no reboot-orchestration call site
found; grade unchanged.)*

### 8.7 Update Summary and Compliance Reporting :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

`PatchManager::get_fleet_patch_summary()` returns fleet-wide patch compliance (per-KB missing
agent counts). `get_missing_patches()` with `PatchQuery` filters by agent, severity, status.
Deployment tracking reports `total_targets` (accurate as of creation); `completed_targets`/
`failed_targets` do not auto-update post-creation (§8.4). **Fleet compliance reporting reads the
same never-populated `patch_inventory` table as §8.5** — see that section and #3676.

### 8.8 Patch Connectivity Testing :white_check_mark: `T2`

`patch_connectivity` action in `windows_updates` plugin. Per-target DNS resolution (getaddrinfo), TCP connect (non-blocking socket), latency measurement. Platform-specific defaults: Windows Update/WSUS, apt/yum repos, Apple SWUpdate.

### 8.9 Patch Inventory Event Generation :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Event emission for SIEM/compliance integration.

---

## 9. Security and Compliance

*Antivirus, firewall, encryption, vulnerability scanning, and device quarantine.*

### 9.1 Antivirus Status and Product Detection :white_check_mark: `T1`

`antivirus` plugin (cross-platform). macOS `products` probes the XProtect
definition bundle (version row; `unknown` when unreadable, never assumed
active) and enumerates endpoint-security system extensions for third-party
EDR/AV; macOS `status` reports XProtect definition version/freshness plus
Remediator/MRT engine versions (`security.antivirus.xprotect_status`).

### 9.2 Firewall Status and Rule Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T1`

`firewall` plugin (cross-platform). macOS `state` reports the Application
Firewall (`socketfilterfw --getglobalstate`) as the primary signal, with the
pf packet filter demoted to a secondary row; `rules` lists pf rules.

### 9.3 Disk Encryption Status :white_check_mark: `T1`

`bitlocker` plugin (cross-platform): Windows BitLocker via an in-process
Win32_EncryptableVolume WMI query + per-volume `GetConversionStatus()`
method call (rung 1, no subprocess), Linux LUKS via in-process libblkid
enumeration + plain `/sys/class/block/dm-*/dm/uuid` reads (`list_luks_volumes`,
rung 1, no subprocess), and macOS FileVault (`fdesetup` + per-APFS-volume
`diskutil apfs list`, direct argv through the bounded subprocess runner,
rung 2) — all three dispatched from the plugin's `state` action.

### 9.4 Vulnerability Scanning :large_orange_diamond: `T1`

`vuln_scan` plugin + NVD database sync on server. Server-side matching now uses
real CPE version ranges (`cve`+`cve_match` schema), but **coverage is still
partial**: the NVD sync now backfills the full CVE catalog newest-first
(configurable window via `--nvd-backfill-years`, default 8y, resumable across
restarts, then periodic freshness re-checks), yet match identity is still
product-name based, not vendor/CPE-precise (false positives from name
collisions possible; vendor precision pending ADR-0018). See
`docs/vuln-scan-roadmap.md`.

> **ADR-1005 grandfathered surface #2.** The server-side NVD sync + CVE
> matching is in-server *interpretation* under ADR-1005's boundary test and is
> grandfathered until re-homed into the first use-case engine (UCE) module —
> a strangler migration gated on a matcher-parity milestone (M3) before any
> server-side deletion; see `docs/adr-1005-execution-plan.md`. The agent-side
> `vuln_scan` collection action is *mechanism* and stays core, but the
> plugin's embedded static CVE rule list (`cve_rules.hpp`) and its use as an
> authoritative `cve_scan` finding source are **frozen (no further rule
> updates) and deprecated** — verified 2026-09-07: `VulnFindingStore::reconcile_agent`
> (`server/core/src/vuln_finding_store.{hpp,cpp}`) has zero production callers — its own
> header literally says "no engine calls `reconcile_agent` yet (PR 4 lands the matching
> engine)" — so the modern matcher/finding-reconciliation path is **design-only — deferred
> to ADR-1005 Phase 7** along with the rest of the vulnerability-management use-case engine;
> do not read the basic plugin+NVD-sync capability above as covering it. The long-term
> replacement is engine-published content delivered through the existing
> content-distribution plane.

### 9.5 Event Log Collection :white_check_mark: `T1`

`event_logs` plugin (cross-platform).

### 9.6 Device Quarantine (Network Isolation) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`quarantine` plugin (cross-platform). `quarantine` action isolates device from network, whitelisting management server and optional IPs via firewall rules (prefixed `YuzuQuarantine_`). `unquarantine` removes rules and restores access. `status` checks active quarantine state. `whitelist` adds/removes IPs from active quarantine.

### 9.7 Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Checking :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ioc` plugin with `check` action. Matches indicators against local endpoint state: `ip_addresses` checked against active TCP/UDP connections, `domains` against DNS cache, `file_hashes` (SHA-256) against files on disk, `file_paths` for existence, `ports` for listening services. Cross-platform: Windows (GetExtendedTcpTable, DnsGetCacheDataTable), Linux (/proc/net/tcp), macOS (lsof).

### 9.8 Certificate Inventory (Get/Delete) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`certificates` plugin with `list`, `details`, and `delete` actions. Enumerates certificates in system stores with thumbprint, subject, issuer, expiry, and key usage. Windows: CryptoAPI (CertOpenStore, CertEnumCertificatesInStore). Linux: PEM files in /etc/ssl/certs/, parsed in-process via libcrypto (no `openssl` shell-out). macOS: System.keychain and SystemRootCertificates.keychain are read natively via SecItem (`SecItemCopyMatching`, no shell-out); the current console user's login keychain still goes through the `launchctl asuser <uid> sudo -n -u <user> security` hop (selectable per query with the `store` param: `System`/`root`/`login`/`all`; the LaunchDaemon has no login keychain of its own). Delete on macOS verifies the certificate is actually absent from the target keychain afterward before reporting success (a tri-state safe delete — command failure, still-present, and an unreadable re-enumeration each block a false "deleted"); `store=root` is rejected as unsupported because SystemRootCertificates.keychain is sealed by System Integrity Protection and cannot be modified.

### 9.9 Quarantine Status Tracking :white_check_mark: `T2`

`QuarantineStore` (PostgreSQL backend, schema `quarantine_store`, ADR-0047). Server-side quarantine records with agent_id, status (active/released), quarantined_by, timestamps, whitelist, and reason. `list_quarantined()` for active quarantines, `get_history()` for per-agent quarantine history. REST API endpoints for quarantine/release/status.

### 9.10 Application Whitelisting :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Modify allow/block lists on endpoint security products.

---

## 10. File System Operations

*Browse, search, inspect, and manipulate files on managed endpoints.*

### 10.1 File and Directory Listing :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin (cross-platform, admin-required).

### 10.2 File Search by Name :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin.

### 10.3 File Content Read (by Line) :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin `read` action with `offset` (1-based line number) and `limit` (max lines, configurable) parameters for line-range access.

### 10.4 File Hash Computation :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin.

### 10.5 File Deletion :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin.

### 10.6 Path Existence Check :white_check_mark: `T1`

`filesystem` plugin.

### 10.7 File Permissions Inspection :white_check_mark: `T2`

`filesystem` plugin `get_acl` action. Windows: full DACL enumeration via GetNamedSecurityInfo — returns each ACE with trustee, access mask, and ace type. Linux/macOS: POSIX `stat()` permissions (owner, group, other, special bits).

### 10.8 Digital Signature Verification :white_check_mark: `T2`

`filesystem` plugin `get_signature` action. Windows: Authenticode verification via WinVerifyTrust — reports signature status (valid, invalid, unsigned, untrusted), signer name, and timestamp. macOS: runs `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and reports an honest macOS status (`valid` = intact seal, `unsigned`, `invalid` = a proven broken seal / bad requirement / corrupt sealed resource, `unknown` = trust/policy/notarization failure or unrecognised diagnostic) — a different vocabulary from Authenticode, since codesign/Gatekeeper model trust differently than WinVerifyTrust; `valid` attests seal integrity, not Gatekeeper/notarization trust. Linux: returns platform-unsupported status.

### 10.9 File Version Info :white_check_mark: `T2`

`get_version_info` action in `filesystem` plugin. Windows: GetFileVersionInfoW/VerQueryValueW for VS_FIXEDFILEINFO + string table. Returns file_version, product_version, company_name, file_description, etc. macOS: reads CFBundleShortVersionString and CFBundleVersion from an app bundle's Info.plist via `plutil -extract` (handles both binary and XML plists), reporting `version_status|not_available` when the target carries no Info.plist or version keys rather than failing. Returns platform-unsupported on Linux.

### 10.10 File Content Search and Replace :white_check_mark: `T2`

Five new actions in `filesystem` plugin: `search` (line-by-line pattern matching, literal or regex), `replace` (atomic temp+rename), `write_content`, `append`, `delete_lines`. All enforce base_dir restrictions. Pattern capped at 256 chars. Binary detection.

### 10.11 Directory Hash (Recursive) :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Integrity verification of directory trees.

### 10.12 Temp File Creation :white_check_mark: `T1`

`yuzu_create_temp_file()` and `yuzu_create_temp_dir()` in SDK with secure permissions (POSIX mkstemps 0600, Windows owner-only DACL). Exposed via filesystem plugin `create_temp`/`create_temp_dir` actions.

### 10.13 File Retrieval (Upload to Server) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`upload_file` action in `content_dist` plugin, via the PR1.6 one-time upload-grant + authenticated chunked-receive protocol (`docs/adr/3004-artifact-blob-storage.md`) — the legacy unauthenticated `POST /api/v1/file-retrieval` endpoint was removed. Operator mints a grant (`POST /api/v1/upload-grants`); the agent redeems it, streams the file in bounded chunks with per-chunk offset CAS, and commits with a SHA-256 computed from the exact bytes acknowledged. File stored in `{data_dir}/upload-blobs/{retention_class}/{grant_id}`. `GET /api/v1/upload-grants` (list) / `DELETE /api/v1/upload-grants/{id}` (revoke) for management.

### 10.14 Find File by Size and Hash :white_check_mark: `T2`

`filesystem` plugin `find_by_hash` action. Searches directory trees for files matching a SHA-256 hash. Used for malware hunting and file integrity verification. Recursive search with configurable root path.

### 10.15 Directory Search by Name :white_check_mark: `T2`

`search_dir` action in `filesystem` plugin. `fs::recursive_directory_iterator` with glob or regex name matching. Parameters: root, pattern, match_type (directories/files/both), max_depth, max_results. Respects base_dir.

---

## 11. Script and Command Execution

*Execute arbitrary scripts and commands on managed endpoints.*

### 11.1 Script Execution (File-Based) :white_check_mark: `T1`

`script_exec` plugin (cross-platform).

### 11.2 Inline Script Execution :white_check_mark: `T1`

`script_exec` plugin accepts inline text.

### 11.3 OS Command Execution :white_check_mark: `T1`

`script_exec` covers this.

### 11.4 Execution Output Streaming :white_check_mark: `T1`

gRPC streaming delivers output in real time.

---

## 12. Registry and System Configuration (Windows)

*Read and modify Windows registry, WMI, and system configuration.*

### 12.1 WMI Query Execution :white_check_mark: `T2`

`wmi` plugin with `query` action. Execute WQL SELECT statements against any WMI namespace with structured property/value output.

### 12.2 WMI Method Invocation :white_check_mark: `T2`

`wmi` plugin with `get_instance` action. Get all properties of a WMI class instance.

### 12.3 WMI Namespace Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T3`

`wmi` plugin supports configurable namespace parameter (default `root\cimv2`).

### 12.4 Registry Key/Value Read :white_check_mark: `T2`

`registry` plugin with `get_value` action. Read values from HKLM, HKCU, HKCR, HKU hives with structured type/value output.

### 12.5 Registry Key/Value Write/Delete :white_check_mark: `T2`

`registry` plugin with `set_value`, `delete_value`, and `delete_key` actions. Support REG_SZ and REG_DWORD types.

### 12.6 Registry Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`registry` plugin with `enumerate_keys` and `enumerate_values` actions. `key_exists` for existence checks.

### 12.7 Per-User Registry Operations :white_check_mark: `T2`

`registry` plugin with `list_profiles` (enumerate local profiles: SID, resolved name, profile path, live hive-load state) and `get_user_value` (read a value from a resolved profile's hive) actions. Both resolve the target profile via `HKLM\...\ProfileList`; `get_user_value` reads the live `HKEY_USERS\<SID>` hive when the user is logged in, or loads that profile's NTUSER.DAT via `RegLoadKey` as a fallback (unloaded via RAII on every exit path, under a per-call salted mount name). SE_RESTORE_NAME and SE_BACKUP_NAME privileges are required only for that offline fallback, which the agent account already holds — no new privilege grant; reading an already-loaded live hive needs no elevated privilege.

The ladder itself lives in `agents/shared/win_profiles.hpp` and is the single implementation for every per-user consumer: `registry`, `installed_apps.list_per_user`, `license_scan`'s per-user surfaces, and `tar`'s outbound mapdrive history. Its offline arm is serialised process-wide, because privilege enabling acts on the process token and all four plugins load into one agent process.

---

## 13. Content Distribution

*Stage and distribute files, packages, and content to endpoints.*

### 13.1 Server-to-Agent Content Staging :white_check_mark: `T2`

`content_dist` plugin with `stage` action. Download files to agent staging directory with SHA256 hash verification. `list_staged` to inventory staged content. `cleanup` to remove staged files.

### 13.2 Stage and Execute (Deploy + Run) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`content_dist` plugin with `execute_staged` action. Execute previously staged files with optional arguments. Returns exit code and output.

### 13.3 HTTP File Download (Agent-Initiated) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`http_client` plugin with `download` action. Download files from arbitrary URLs with optional SHA256 hash verification. `get` and `head` actions for HTTP requests.

### 13.4 HTTP POST (Agent-Initiated) :white_check_mark: `T3`

`http_client` plugin supports HTTP operations. Agent can fetch content from external URLs.

### 13.5 Peer-to-Peer Content Distribution :x: `T3`

Not implemented. P2P caching to reduce WAN bandwidth. Requires agent mesh networking.

---

## 14. User Interaction

*Display notifications, surveys, and dialogs on endpoint desktops.*

### 14.1 Desktop Notification :white_check_mark: `T2`

`interaction` plugin with `notify` action. Toast/balloon notifications with info/warning/error severity. Cross-platform: ShellNotifyIcon (Windows), notify-send (Linux), osascript (macOS).

### 14.2 Announcement Dialog :white_check_mark: `T2`

`interaction` plugin with `message_box` action. Modal message box with configurable buttons (ok, okcancel, yesno). Returns the user's button in `response`. On macOS the agent is a GUI-less root LaunchDaemon: when no desktop session can be reached it reports `status|not_reachable` honestly (never a fabricated `response|ok`). Delivering a dialog to the logged-in user's session is a deferred per-session helper.

### 14.3 Question / Confirmation Dialog :white_check_mark: `T2`

`interaction` plugin with `input` action. Text input dialog with configurable prompt and default value. Returns entered text or cancellation. MessageBoxW (Windows), zenity (Linux), osascript (macOS).

### 14.4 Survey Dialog :white_check_mark: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped. `interaction` plugin `survey` action — multi-question form via `zenity` (Linux, supported), `powershell_winforms` (Windows, supported), `osascript` (macOS, constrained — no reachable GUI session under the headless/root LaunchDaemon). *(Evidence: `agents/plugins/interaction/src/interaction_plugin.cpp`, `"survey"` action registered ~line 1284, dispatched via `do_survey()`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

### 14.5 Do-Not-Disturb Mode :white_check_mark: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped. `interaction` plugin `set_dnd` action — enables/disables DND with an optional expiry, suppresses `notify` calls while active (`is_dnd_active()` gate in `do_notify()`), and persists state across restarts via the agent's local KV store (`local_kv_store`) on all three platforms. *(Evidence: `agents/plugins/interaction/src/interaction_plugin.cpp`, `"set_dnd"` action ~line 1290, state restore in `init()`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

### 14.6 Active Response Tracking :x: `T3`

Not implemented. List all active survey/question responses waiting for user input.

---

## 15. Inventory and Data Collection

*Structured inventory collection, storage, querying, and replication.*

### 15.1 Plugin-Based Inventory Reporting :white_check_mark: `T1`

`ReportInventory` RPC with per-plugin data blobs.

### 15.2 Inventory Persistence and Query :white_check_mark: `T1`

`QueryInventory` RPC on management API. Server stores inventory.

> **Gap:** No advanced query language (filtering, joins).

### 15.3 Inventory Table Enumeration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`InventoryStore::list_tables()` returns all distinct inventory "tables" (one per plugin) with agent count and last collection timestamp. REST API endpoint and MCP `list_inventory_tables` tool expose this data.

### 15.4 Inventory Evaluation (Item Lookup) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`inventory_eval.hpp/cpp` evaluation engine. JSON dot-path field extraction, 10 comparison operators including version_gte/version_lte (semver-aware). REST: `POST /api/v1/inventory/evaluate` with conditions array and AND/OR combine.

### 15.5 Inventory Replication (Local Replica) :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Agent-side cache with delta sync.

---

## 16. Policy and Compliance Engine (Server-Side Guaranteed State)

*Define desired-state policies, evaluate compliance on a poll-based schedule, and auto-remediate. This domain covers the **server-side** half of guaranteed state — definition, fleet-wide compliance evaluation, history, drill-down. Real-time **agent-side** enforcement (kernel-event-driven, millisecond-level, pre-login, offline-capable) lives in §31 (System Guardian) and is the operational primitive that makes "this setting must never be in a non-compliant state" actually true on disk. A complete guaranteed-state implementation requires both halves — §16 alone has a 5-minute poll cycle that is unacceptable for security-sensitive settings (firewall, registry, EDR process running, SSH config).*

### 16.1 Policy Rules Definition :white_check_mark: `T2`

`PolicyStore` with `PolicyFragment` (check/fix/postCheck pattern) and `Policy` kinds. YAML-defined with CEL compliance expressions. CRUD via REST API.

### 16.2 Policy Evaluation and Enforcement :white_check_mark: `T2`

`PolicyStore` tracks per-agent compliance status (compliant, non_compliant, unknown, fixing, error). Trigger-based evaluation with configurable trigger types (interval, file_change, service_status, event_log, registry, startup).

### 16.3 Policy Assignment to Device Groups :white_check_mark: `T2`

Policies support management group bindings via `PolicyGroupBinding`. Scope expressions for device targeting.

### 16.4 Compliance Summary and Statistics :white_check_mark: `T2`

`FleetCompliance` aggregate with compliance percentage. Per-policy `ComplianceSummary`. Compliance dashboard with fleet-level and per-policy drill-down to agent-level detail.

### 16.5 Evaluation History and Audit Trail :white_check_mark: `T2`

`PolicyAgentStatus` tracks last_check_at, last_fix_at, and check_result per agent per policy. Queryable via REST API.

### 16.6 Policy Event Subscriptions :white_check_mark: `T3`

Policy status changes tracked in compliance store. REST API endpoints expose compliance data for external consumption.

### 16.7 Cache Invalidation and Force Re-Evaluation :white_check_mark: `T2`

`invalidate_policy()` resets all agent statuses to pending for a specific policy. `invalidate_all_policies()` for fleet-wide reset. REST endpoints: `POST /api/policies/{id}/invalidate` and `POST /api/policies/invalidate-all`.

### 16.8 Pending Policy Changes Review :white_check_mark: `T2`

Policies support enable/disable toggle for staged deployment. REST endpoints: `POST /api/policies/{id}/enable` and `POST /api/policies/{id}/disable`.

---

## 17. Triggers and Event-Driven Automation

*React to endpoint events in real time: file changes, service state, intervals.*

### 17.1 Interval-Based Trigger :white_check_mark: `T2`

Trigger engine with `interval` type. Timer-based execution with configurable seconds/minutes/hours.

### 17.2 File / Directory Change Trigger :white_check_mark: `T2`

Trigger engine with `file_change` and `directory_change` types. Filesystem watcher using inotify (Linux), FSEvents (macOS), ReadDirectoryChangesW (Windows).

### 17.3 Service Status Change Trigger :white_check_mark: `T2`

Trigger engine with `service_status_change` type. React to service start/stop/crash via Windows SCM or systemd on Linux.

### 17.4 Windows Event Log Trigger :white_check_mark: `T2`

Trigger engine with `event_log` type. React to Windows Event Log entries matching XPath filters.

### 17.5 Registry Change Trigger :white_check_mark: `T3`

Trigger engine with `registry` type. React to registry key modifications on Windows.

### 17.6 Agent Startup Trigger :white_check_mark: `T2`

Trigger engine with `agent_startup` type. Execute actions on agent boot.

### 17.7 Trigger Templates (Server-Side) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`TriggerTemplate` YAML kind (`yuzu.io/v1alpha1`) for server-defined trigger configurations. Pre-configured trigger variants managed server-side and pushed to agents.

---

## 18. Server: Authentication and Authorization

*User authentication, role-based access control, and session management.*

### 18.1 Session-Based Authentication :white_check_mark: `T1`

Session-cookie auth with PBKDF2-hashed passwords.

### 18.2 Role-Based Access Control (Two Roles) :white_check_mark: `T1`

`admin` (full access) and `user` (read-only).

### 18.3 Granular RBAC :white_check_mark: `T2`

`RBACStore` (777 LOC): principals, custom roles, 10 securable types (Infrastructure, UserManagement, InstructionDefinition, InstructionSet, Execution, Schedule, Approval, Tag, AuditLog, Response), 5 operations (Read, Write, Execute, Delete, Approve). Deny-override, system roles, group-based assignments. Global enable/disable toggle.

### 18.4 Management-Group-Scoped Roles :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ManagementGroupStore` supports group-scoped role assignments. `assign_role()` / `unassign_role()` bind principals to roles within a specific group. `get_visible_agents()` resolves the candidate agent set for a user's group-scoped roles. REST endpoints at `/api/v1/management-groups/{id}/roles` (GET/POST/DELETE). RBAC integration enforces group-scoped visibility on **per-device** routes and, as of #1634, on the **response/execution** list/fan-out family (`query_responses`/`aggregate_responses`, `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/events`, `GET /sse/executions/{id}`, MCP `get_execution_status`/`list_executions`) via the ADR-0017 admit-then-filter list gate — see `docs/auth-architecture.md` "Third migration (#1634)". Software-inventory reads (`query_installed_software`, `GET /api/v1/inventory/software`) are also already effectively confined (#3290 Phase 2). Confinement of the remaining list/fan-out surfaces (agent lists, the generic `query_inventory`/`get_agent_inventory` blob routes) is tracked by the same ADR-0017 ladder.

### 18.5 OIDC / SSO Integration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`OidcProvider` (575 LOC): PKCE authorization code flow, OpenID Connect discovery, JWT validation (iss, aud, nonce, exp), Entra ID group claim parsing, group-to-role mapping (`--oidc-admin-group`), token exchange via platform HTTP (WinHTTP/httplib). Login page SSO button active. Runtime-configurable via Settings UI (`POST /api/settings/oidc`) — admin can enter issuer, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, and admin_group from the dashboard without server restart - though the swap is process-local and a restart reverts to the CLI/env values. "Test Connection" button validates OIDC discovery endpoint. TLS cert verification configurable (`--oidc-skip-tls-verify`).

### 18.6 Active Directory / Entra Integration :white_check_mark: `T2`

`DirectorySync` (ADR-0063: migrated to PostgreSQL, schema `directory_sync`). Entra ID sync via Microsoft Graph API (OAuth2 client credentials flow). Fetches `/users` and `/groups`, stores in Postgres (fail-closed construction; FK + `ON DELETE CASCADE` on memberships, new in this migration). Group-to-role mapping (`configure_group_role_mapping`) maps directory groups to RBAC roles. LDAP sync stub for on-prem AD (full LDAP support planned). REST API endpoints for sync trigger, status, and mapping CRUD. Settings UI section active.

### 18.7 Token-Based API Authentication :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ApiTokenStore` with SQLite backend. Tokens generated via `POST /api/v1/tokens` with optional expiry. Auth via `Authorization: Bearer` header or `X-Yuzu-Token` header. RBAC permissions: `ApiToken:Read`, `ApiToken:Write`, `ApiToken:Delete`. Tokens support optional `mcp_tier` field for MCP integration (readonly/operator/supervised). Settings UI token management with create/revoke.

### 18.8 Device Authorization Tokens :white_check_mark: `T2`

`DeviceTokenStore` (PostgreSQL, ADR-0052) with SHA-256 hashed tokens, device_id and definition_id scoping. REST: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/device-tokens`. **Dormant** (same family as `LicenseStore`/ADR-0048 and `SoftwareDeploymentStore`/ADR-0051) — the store is migrated and tested but not constructed by the server, so these routes do not register today.

### 18.9 HTTPS for Web Dashboard :white_check_mark: `T1`

`httplib::SSLServer` with OpenSSL. CLI flags: `--https`, `--https-port`, `--https-cert`, `--https-key`, `--no-https-redirect`. HTTP-to-HTTPS 301 redirect. Secure cookie flag. Settings UI TLS configuration section.

### 18.10 Two-Factor Authentication :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped (SOC 2 CC6.6 privileged-access MFA ladder). RFC 6238 TOTP + RFC 4648 base32 + `otpauth://` URI builder (`totp.cpp`), per-user enrollment with QR code (`mfa_qr.cpp`), and a step-up gate (`mfa_step_up.cpp`) that blocks high-risk REST/Settings handlers unless `Session::mfa_verified_at` is fresh within `mfa_step_up_window_secs` — API-token/MCP-token principals skip step-up by design (the bearer credential is the step-up moment). Retitled from "...for Approvals" — the shipped scope is login-time TOTP + step-up on privileged handlers generally, not specifically the instruction-approval workflow. Email-based OTP fallback not found; scope narrower than the original row's aspiration in that respect. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/totp.{hpp,cpp}`, `mfa_qr.{hpp,cpp}`, `mfa_step_up.{hpp,cpp}`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

---

## 19. Server: Device and Group Management

*Organize endpoints into groups, scope operations, and manage device metadata.*

### 19.1 Agent Listing and Detail View :white_check_mark: `T1`

### 19.2 Agent Lifecycle Events :white_check_mark: `T1`

`WatchEvents` RPC streams connect/disconnect/plugin-load events.

### 19.3 Scope / Filter-Based Device Selection :white_check_mark: `T2`

750-line recursive-descent `ScopeEngine` parser. 10 binary operators (`==`, `!=`, `LIKE`, `MATCHES`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `IN`, `CONTAINS`) plus 3 extended operators/functions (`EXISTS`, `LEN()`, `STARTSWITH()`), AND/OR/NOT combinators. `MATCHES` uses ECMAScript regex with safe error handling. Attributes: ostype, osver, hostname, arch, fqdn, `tag:*`. Target estimation via `/api/scope/estimate`.

### 19.4 Hierarchical Management Groups :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ManagementGroupStore` with `parent_id` for nesting. `get_children()` returns direct children. `get_ancestor_ids()` / `get_descendant_ids()` traverse the hierarchy. Static membership (manual add/remove) and dynamic membership (scope expression evaluation via `refresh_dynamic_membership()`). Well-known root group. REST CRUD + hierarchy endpoints. Group-scoped role assignments for access control.

### 19.5 Device Discovery (Unmanaged Endpoints) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`discovery` agent plugin (`scan_subnet` action) performs ARP scan + ping sweep of CIDR subnets. Server-side `DiscoveryStore` persists discovered devices with IP, MAC, hostname, managed status, discovering agent, and subnet. `mark_managed()` links discovered IPs to enrolled agents. REST API for listing and clearing results.

### 19.6 Custom Properties on Devices :white_check_mark: `T2`

`CustomPropertiesStore` (462 LOC). Typed key-value properties per device: string, int, bool, datetime. Schema CRUD with validation regex. Usable in scope expressions via `props.<key>`. Property validation against schemas. REST API for property and schema CRUD. Key validation (1-64 chars, `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-:]`), value limit 1024 bytes.

### 19.7 Agent Deployment Jobs :white_check_mark: `T2`

`DeploymentStore` with job management. Create deployment jobs targeting discovered hosts by IP, OS, and method (ssh, group_policy, manual). Job lifecycle: pending → running → completed/failed/cancelled. REST API for job CRUD, status updates, and cancellation.

---

## 20. Server: Response Collection and Reporting

*Aggregate, filter, paginate, and export command results.*

### 20.1 Real-Time Response Streaming :white_check_mark: `T1`

SSE-based streaming to dashboard. gRPC streaming for programmatic access.

### 20.2 Response Filtering and Pagination :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ResponseStore` with SQLite backend. `ResponseQuery` struct: agent_id, status, time range (since/until), limit/offset pagination. Exposed via `GET /api/responses/{instruction_id}` with query parameters.

### 20.3 Response Aggregation :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ResponseStore` aggregation engine with COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX. Multi-column GROUP BY, incremental computation as responses arrive. REST endpoint with drill-down from aggregate to raw rows.

### 20.4 Per-Device Error Tracking :white_check_mark: `T2`

`ResponseStore` persists per-response `error_detail` alongside status. Queryable by agent_id, status code, and time range for error history.

### 20.5 CSV / Data Export :white_check_mark: `T2`

CSV and JSON export endpoints for responses, audit, and inventory data. RFC 4180-compliant CSV with streaming via chunked transfer encoding. Generic JSON-to-CSV conversion.

### 20.6 Response Templates :white_check_mark: `T2`

Named response-view configurations (column subset, sort order, filter presets) attached to an `InstructionDefinition`. Synthesised `__default__` view derived from `spec.result.columns` (or the plugin's column schema) so every definition has at least one selectable view. REST CRUD at `/api/v1/definitions/{id}/response-templates[/{template_id}]` gated on `InstructionDefinition:Read` (List/Get) and `InstructionDefinition:Write` (POST/PUT/DELETE). Dashboard surfaces the templates as a **View** dropdown in the filter bar; selecting one re-renders the table with the template's column subset, sort order, and equals-op filters auto-applied. YAML authoring via `spec.responseTemplates`. Phase 8.2, issue #254.

### 20.7 Response Offloading :white_check_mark: `T3`

Operator-registered external HTTP endpoints (*offload targets*) that receive a copy of `agent.registered` and `execution.completed` events as they fire. Sibling `OffloadTargetStore` (Postgres schema `offload_target_store`, ADR-0059) wired into `AgentServiceImpl` next to the existing webhook fan-out — every event that fires a webhook also fans out to every enabled offload target whose `event_types` filter matches. Typed auth: none / bearer / basic / hmac (Authorization headers are CRLF-guarded against header injection). Server-side batching: `batch_size > 1` accumulates events into a per-target buffer and flushes on threshold; flush body is JSON of shape `{"events":[…]}`. REST CRUD at `/api/v1/offload-targets` gated on `Infrastructure:Read`/`Write`. `auth_credential` is `SecretCodec`-encrypted at rest (ADR-0010) and never returned by any read endpoint (a `has_credential` flag reports whether one is configured; paranoia-double-check assertion in REST tests). YAML authoring via `spec.offload.targets` is documented; dispatcher-side correlation (per-instruction filter honouring) deferred to a follow-up. Phase 8.3, issue #255.

### 20.8 Executions-History Ladder and Agentic Event Stream :white_check_mark: `T2` *(new row, v4.0)* *(verified 2026-09-07)*

The `command_id → execution_id` map + `ExecutionEventBus` SSE stream unifying dashboard and REST/MCP execution visibility behind one taxonomy (`/api/v1/events`) — never per-route event formats. `execute_instruction` (REST + MCP) is a tracked-execution producer. A4 error-envelope shape lives in `rest_a4_envelope.hpp`. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/execution_event_bus.{hpp,cpp}`, `execution_tracker.{hpp,cpp}`, `rest_a4_envelope.hpp` + `rest_a4_envelope_http.hpp`; design: `docs/executions-history-ladder.md`; verified 2026-09-07.)*

## 21. Server: Notifications and Audit

*System events, audit trails, and external notification delivery.*

### 21.1 Agent Lifecycle Event Streaming :white_check_mark: `T1`

`WatchEvents` RPC.

### 21.2 Audit Trail of User Actions :white_check_mark: `T2`

`AuditStore` (migrated to PostgreSQL, ADR-0040/Wave 1.3, PR #2697 — fail-hard writes, degrade→deny reads, SOC-2 evidence chain; verified 2026-09-07 via `pg::PgPool`/`pg::PgMigration` usage in `audit_store.cpp`, previous row text stale-claimed SQLite). Structured events: timestamp, principal, principal_role, action, target_type, target_id, detail, source_ip, result. Query with filtering and pagination via `/api/audit`. Default 365-day retention.

### 21.3 System Notifications :white_check_mark: `T2`

`NotificationStore` (migrated to PostgreSQL; verified 2026-09-07 via `pg::PgPool` constructor in `notification_store.cpp`, previous row text stale-claimed SQLite). Create notifications with level (info/warn/error/success), title, and message. List unread/all, mark as read, dismiss (soft-delete), count unread. Server generates notifications for system events (agent registration, policy violations, deployment completions). REST API and dashboard bell icon integration.

### 21.4 Event Subscriptions (Webhook / Email) :white_check_mark: `T3`

`WebhookStore` (437 LOC). Register webhooks with URL, event type filter (comma-separated), and HMAC-SHA256 signing secret. Async delivery on detached threads with 10-concurrent-delivery semaphore. Delivery history with status codes and errors. `fire_event()` dispatches matching webhooks automatically. REST API for webhook CRUD and delivery log.

### 21.5 Event Source Management :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Configure which events generate notifications.

### 21.6 Behavioral-PII Access-Audit Chokepoint :white_check_mark: `T2` *(new row, v4.0)* *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Every behavioural-PII read (device-live-info, process/network drill, DEX perf, etc.) funnels through the single `emit_behavioral_audit` chokepoint (#1647) — with one tracked exception: the REST `device.live.*` incarnation still uses an inline bool-capture (tracked under #1647, open; #1703 was closed unverified in the 2026-07-14 backlog reset — the gap is confirmed live at `rest_api_v1.cpp:10535`) — REST fail-closed 503 + `Sec-Audit-Failed` header on an audit-write failure, dashboard/MCP set-and-proceed. Standing invariant: no new PII route may reintroduce an inline bool-capture bypassing the chokepoint. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/rest_audit.hpp` `emit_behavioral_audit`; verified 2026-09-07.)*

---

## 22. Server: System and Infrastructure

*Monitoring, licensing, configuration, and multi-node scaling.*

### 22.1 System Health Monitoring :white_check_mark: `T2`

Kubernetes-style health probes: `/livez` (always 200) and `/readyz` (checks store connectivity). Gateway health endpoint with circuit breaker status. Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint exposes server/agent/gateway metrics. `ProcessHealthSampler` provides cross-platform (Linux `/proc/self`, macOS `mach_task_info`/`getrusage`, Windows `GetProcessMemoryInfo`/`GetProcessTimes`) process telemetry sampled every 15s. New Prometheus metrics: `yuzu_server_cpu_usage_percent`, `yuzu_server_memory_bytes{type=rss|vss}`, `yuzu_server_open_connections`, `yuzu_server_command_queue_depth`, `yuzu_server_uptime_seconds`. `/health` endpoint includes `system` object with CPU, memory, connections, queue depth. Health dashboard strip shows CPU% and memory.

### 22.2 System Topology View :white_check_mark: `T2`

`topology_ui.cpp` dashboard page at `/topology`. HTMX fragment `/frag/topology-data` (30s poll). Shows server node, gateway badges, management group tree, OS breakdown. REST: `GET /api/v1/topology`.

### 22.3 License Management :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`LicenseStore` with seat-based licensing, expiry, edition, feature flags. Soft enforcement with alerts when the seat count is exceeded or expiry is within 30 days (`license_store.cpp:447,458` — no 90% early-warning threshold exists). REST: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/license`, `GET /api/v1/license/alerts`. **Dormant** (ADR-0048) — the store is migrated and tested but not constructed by the server, so these routes do not register today. **Regraded ✅ Done → 🔶 Partial (ADR-0048; regraded 2026-09-07)** — the store's own file header states it is "DELIBERATELY DORMANT on `dev`": nothing in `server.cpp` constructs a `LicenseStore`, so a fully-implemented, fully-tested capability that is not wired up in the running server is not a delivered capability. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/license_store.hpp` header comment; verified 2026-09-07. Not to be confused with §27 Software Licensing & Entitlements — this store is Yuzu's own product licensing, unrelated to customer software-license discovery.)*

### 22.4 Platform Configuration (TTLs, Limits) :white_check_mark: `T2`

`RuntimeConfigStore`. Persistent runtime configuration overrides in PostgreSQL (ADR-0060). Allow-listed keys only, **including one credential** (`oidc_client_secret`, SecretCodec-envelope-encrypted at rest, ADR-0010) - `is_secret_key` gates every emitter (startup log, `GET /api/config`, the `config.update` audit detail, and the `PUT` response echo) so the value is not returned or logged; pre-existing audit rows are redacted when read. Set/get/remove with `updated_by` attribution. **Only some keys take effect without a restart**: the three retention keys are stored-only until a restart, DEX-alert keys until a restart or a Settings-UI save, OIDC keys apply ONLY via a Settings-UI save (a restart does not apply them), and `auto_approve_enabled` is never read back from this store - see `docs/user-manual/rest-api.md` "Runtime Configuration". REST API for configuration CRUD. Startup defaults overridden by stored values.

### 22.5 Gateway / Scale-Out Architecture :white_check_mark: `T2`

Full Erlang/OTP gateway (`gateway/` rebar3 project). `yuzu_gw_agent` manages agent connections, `yuzu_gw_upstream` handles server-side gRPC (batch heartbeat, proxy register, command forwarding). `yuzu_gw_heartbeat_buffer` batches heartbeats for efficiency. Circuit breaker for upstream resilience. Health endpoint with metrics. Supervision tree with restart strategies. EUnit + Common Test suites including scale tests (10K+ agents).

### 22.6 Statistics Dashboard :white_check_mark: `T2`

`statistics_ui.cpp` dashboard page at `/statistics`. Six HTMX cards (fleet, executions, compliance, top instructions, license, system health) each with independent 60s polling. REST: `GET /api/v1/statistics`.

### 22.7 Binary Resource Distribution :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Distribute versioned binary resources via server.

### 22.8 Product Packs (Bundled Definitions) :white_check_mark: `T3`

`ProductPackStore` (680 LOC). Install multi-document YAML bundles containing InstructionDefinitions, PolicyFragments, Policies, TriggerTemplates. Ed25519 signature verification (OpenSSL on Unix, BCrypt on Windows). Install/uninstall with callback delegation to origin stores. Pack metadata, item tracking, and version management. REST API for pack CRUD.

### 22.9 Database Sharding (Response Partitioning) :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Time-partitioned response storage (monthly SQLite files) with automatic rotation, TTL cleanup, and transparent cross-partition query routing.

### 22.10 High Availability (ADR-2002) :large_orange_diamond: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Design + one unwired component, not live HA — and not active-passive: ADR-2002 explicitly disavows that model (the earlier title here was wrong). Delivered so far per `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md`: WS-0 durable idempotency, WS-1 Postgres-backed session state, WS-7 Patroni compose, WS-2a-1 transactional outbox; WS-10 job-safety classification merged after this baseline (#4092). The undelivered core is leader election: ADR-2002 (accepted) specifies a fenced, Postgres-backed leader election model (WS-3): a dedicated connection holding a session-scoped advisory lock, an epoch fence that gates every mutating operation, two dispatch planes. `LeaderElector` (`server/core/src/leader_elector.{hpp,cpp}`) implements this and compiles into `server/core/meson.build`, but has **zero call sites outside its own translation unit** — no `server.cpp` construction, nothing wires it into the boot sequence — so no automatic failover, inter-server heartbeat, or gateway re-registration exists at runtime today. Several other server modules (ExecutionTracker's `ExecutionEventBus`, ScheduleEngine's `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) carry forward-pointers to ADR-2002 for their own eventual multi-replica story. *(Evidence: `docs/adr/0061-update-registry-postgres-migration.md`, `docs/adr/0065-instruction-cluster-postgres-migration.md` ADR-2002 references; `grep -rl LeaderElector server/core/src/*.cpp` returns only `leader_elector.cpp` itself; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

---

## 23. Agent-Side Key-Value Storage

*Persistent key-value store on the agent for cross-instruction state.*

### 23.1 Local Key-Value Storage :white_check_mark: `T2`

`storage` plugin with `set`, `get`, `delete`, `list`, `clear` actions. SQLite-backed persistent key-value store on the agent. Keys namespaced per plugin. Survives agent restarts and upgrades.

### 23.2 Remote Key-Value Access :white_check_mark: `T3`

`storage` plugin actions are dispatchable via server instructions. Server can remotely read/write agent storage via standard command dispatch.

### 23.3 Key Existence Check :white_check_mark: `T2`

`storage` plugin `list` action with optional prefix filter. `get` returns empty result for non-existent keys.

---

## 24. Integration and Extensibility

*External system integration, data exchange, and API surface.*

### 24.1 Plugin SDK (C ABI + C++ Wrapper) :white_check_mark: `T1`

Stable `plugin.h` C ABI with `plugin.hpp` CRTP wrapper. `YUZU_PLUGIN_EXPORT` macro.

### 24.2 gRPC Management API :white_check_mark: `T1`

`ManagementService` with list/get/send/watch/query.

### 24.3 REST / HTTP Management API :white_check_mark: `T2`

70+ JSON endpoints under versioned `/api/v1/` prefix. Full CRUD for instructions, executions, schedules, approvals, responses, audit, tags, scope, management groups, policies, tokens, inventory, patches, webhooks, notifications, discovery, and custom properties. Session cookie, OIDC, and API token auth. CORS origin allowlist. OpenAPI spec at `/api/v1/openapi.json`. Consistent JSON error envelopes.

### 24.4 Consumer (External System) Registration :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Register external systems to receive data feeds.

### 24.5 Data Export to External Formats :white_check_mark: `T2`

CSV and JSON export endpoints. RFC 4180-compliant CSV with streaming via chunked transfer encoding. Generic `json_array_to_csv` converter at `/api/export/json-to-csv`. Response data export with Content-Disposition headers. Audit log and inventory data also exportable via REST API JSON endpoints.

### 24.6 Utility Functions (JSON/Table Conversion) :white_check_mark: `T1`

`yuzu_table_to_json()`, `yuzu_json_to_table()`, `yuzu_split_lines()`, `yuzu_generate_sequence()`, `yuzu_free_string()` in `sdk/include/yuzu/plugin.h` C ABI.

### 24.7 SDK Libraries for External Integrations :x: `T3`

Not implemented. Client libraries wrapping the management API for third-party integration.

### 24.8 MCP Server (Model Context Protocol) :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Embedded MCP server at `POST /mcp/v1/` using JSON-RPC 2.0 transport. Enables AI models (e.g., Claude Desktop) to query fleet status, check compliance, and investigate agents. Phase 1 (historical): 22 read-only tools, 3 resources, 4 prompts. **Update 2026-09-07: 91 tools registered** — directly counted this session via `awk` over the `kTools[]` array in `server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp` (`awk '/^static const ToolDef kTools\[\] = \{/{f=1;next} f && /^\};/{exit} f' server/core/src/mcp_server.cpp | grep -cE '^    \{"'` → 91), spanning DEX perf twins, TAR, inventory, executions, preflight/deployment/verify, PKI, and license/SLE discovery among others. The write surface is broader than the historical single-dispatch note implied, and every tool honours the tier-before-RBAC ordering (§24.9). **Corrected 2026-09-08 (governance EA-H1):** the A5 annotation claim was overstated — precision over slogan: **91/91 tools carry the four standard spec annotations (readOnlyHint/destructiveHint/idempotentHint/openWorldHint) and 91/91 advertise an `outputSchema`; typed-ness (vs. a placeholder/`additionalProperties:true` shape) is not yet 91/91** — the one open structural sub-gap is the streamed-final fallback envelope (`McpStreamBridge::build_fallback_final()`), tracked in issue #2990 (`docs/agentic-first-principle.md` §"Today" survey), plus at least one tool (`list_engine_principals`) whose array items remain `additionalProperties:true` rather than fully typed. Do not read "every tool honours the A5 contract" as 100% typed-ness — it means 100% annotated + 100% `outputSchema`-present, with a small, named, tracked residual on full typing.

### 24.9 MCP Authorization Tiers :white_check_mark: `T2`

Three-tier authorization model enforced before RBAC: `readonly` (read-only tools), `operator` (+ tag writes, auto-approved executions), `supervised` (all operations via approval workflow). MCP tokens use existing API token system with `mcp_tier` column. Mandatory expiration (max 90 days). Kill switch: `--mcp-disable` rejects all MCP requests, `--mcp-read-only` blocks non-read tools.

### 24.10 MCP Settings UI :white_check_mark: `T2`

Settings page section for MCP configuration: enable/disable toggle, read-only mode toggle. API token creation supports MCP tier dropdown for creating MCP-scoped tokens.

### 24.11 MCP Streamed HTTP Transport :white_check_mark: `T2` *(new row, v4.0)* *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Streamable HTTP transport per ADR-1005 exec-plan Decision 15 / track 2f — sessions, GET SSE, and a progress bridge alongside the original single-request JSON-RPC transport, giving long-running MCP tool calls (e.g. `execute_instruction`) a streamed progress channel joining the executions-history ladder (§20.8) as a third bus consumer. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/mcp_transport.{hpp,cpp}`, `mcp_session.{hpp,cpp}`, `mcp_stream_bridge.{hpp,cpp}`; design: `docs/mcp-server.md`; verified 2026-09-07.)*

---

## 25. Connector Framework

*Bidirectional data sync with external management systems.*

### 25.1 Connector Registry and Configuration :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Pluggable connector architecture for syncing inventory data from external systems. ConnectorStore with encrypted credentials, sync scheduling, and connection testing.

### 25.2 Connector Sync Engine :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Background sync execution with lifecycle management (NotStarted → Pending → InProgress → Completed/Failed/Cancelled).

### 25.3 SCCM / ConfigMgr Connector :x: `T2`

Not implemented. SQL query integration with ConfigMgr database for hardware, software, user, and patch inventory.

### 25.4 Intune Connector :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Microsoft Graph API integration for managed device inventory and compliance state.

### 25.5 ServiceNow Connector :x: `T2`

Not implemented. REST API integration with ServiceNow CMDB for CI records, incidents, and change requests.

---

## 26. Inventory Repositories

*Named, multi-source inventory partitions with consolidation and normalization.*

### 26.1 Repository Model :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Named repositories per type (inventory, compliance, entitlement) with connector bindings and default repository.

### 26.2 Inventory Consolidation :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Multi-source deduplication by device identity (hostname + MAC + serial). Consolidation reports showing matched vs. unmatched records.

### 26.3 Software Normalization :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. `SoftwareCatalogRollup` (`server/core/src/software_catalog_rollup.{hpp,cpp}`) canonicalizes vendor/title/version from the ADR-0016 `installed_software` daily-sync source for the `/inventory` dashboard's catalogue view. This is the `/inventory`-scoped normalization pipeline (§35.4), not a general-purpose, repository-model-backed consolidation pipeline (§26.1/26.2 remain Not Started — no `Repository` model, no multi-source dedup-by-device-identity). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/software_catalog_rollup.cpp`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

### 26.4 WSUS / CSV / File Upload Connectors :x: `T2`

Not implemented. WSUS database connector for patch compliance. CSV/TSV file upload connector with configurable column mapping.

---

## 27. Software Licensing & Entitlements (SLE)

*Normalized software identification, agent-discovered software licences, entitlements, and compliance management. Renamed from "Software Catalog & Licensing" by ADR-0024 ("software catalog" keeps its existing `/inventory` meaning; design of record: `docs/adr/0024-software-licensing-entitlements.md`). Sub-capability descriptions below predate ADR-0024 and are stale where they conflict with it.*

### 27.1 Product Registry :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. `ProductRegistryStore` (`server/core/src/product_registry_store.{hpp,cpp}`) ships the canonical-identity plane: a `products` row per canonical identity keyed by the deterministic `product_normalize` norm key, plus `product_aliases` match links recording how each raw `(source, raw_name, raw_publisher)` triple resolved onto a canonical row — `method` + `confidence` persisted so manual curation can layer on later without redesign (ADR-0024 Decision 6), exactly as designed. **Missing:** no curation UI to review/edit aliases, and no dedicated dashboard surface (the discovery flows through `/api/v1/sle/*` and its MCP twin, §27.5). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/product_registry_store.hpp`, `product_normalize.hpp`; wired in `server.cpp` ~line 6615; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started. Correction to the source audit brief: this row's evidence is `product_registry_store.cpp`, NOT `license_store.cpp` — the latter is §22.3's unrelated, dormant, Yuzu-self-licensing store.)*

### 27.2 Software Usage Tracking :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Agent-side application usage metering — **opt-in** (`--usage-sync-enable`, default off) and **machine-scope** (user dimension dropped on-device), read locally from the agent's TAR warehouse (ADR-0024 Decision 15), not on-by-default launch tracking. Categorization (Used, Rarely, Unused, Unreported) is policy-computed server-side at read time; the reclamation verdicts derived from it are SAM use-case-engine-module work (ADR-0024 "Placement under ADR-1005").

### 27.3 License Entitlements & Compliance :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Entitlement records (product, metric-typed quantity — seats in v1 — license_type, term/renewal, cost) from five sources. Compliance calculation: installed vs. entitled with over/under-licensed reporting (ADR-0024 Decision 12; non-seat metrics stored faithfully, evaluated per the ADR's Direction ladder).

### 27.4 Software Tags :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Server-side tags on product registry entries for categorization (approved, prohibited, eval). Usable in Management Group rules.

### 27.5 License Compliance Dashboard :x: `T2`

Not implemented, and **re-scoped** by ADR-0024's "Placement under ADR-1005": the per-product compliance summary, the compliance dashboard, and reclamation-candidate identification are **SAM use-case-engine (UCE) module** surfaces, not built in-server. §27 v1 so far ships the in-server discovery **API** only — the raw `/api/v1/sle/*` drill, its `query_software_licenses` MCP twin, and the audited erasure DELETE. **No SLE UI ships yet:** the in-server **Licences (discovery) view** that Decision 9 places in-server is still to be built, and the compliance / entitlement / reclamation views are the UCE module's, which reads the discovery API over the versioned interface.

---

## 28. Response Visualization

*Chart rendering, data processing, and template management for instruction responses.*

### 28.1 Response Visualization Engine :white_check_mark: `T2`

Implemented. Server-side data transformation with built-in processors (`single_series`, `multi_series`, `datetime_series`) and an optional row pre-filter (`whereField` / `whereEquals`). Chart types: pie, bar, column, line, area. Configured via `spec.visualization` (singular) or `spec.visualizations` (plural for multi-chart). REST: `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}/visualization?definition_id=<id>&index=<N>` gated on `Response:Read`. Renderer is Apache ECharts 5 (vendored at `/static/echarts.min.js`) wrapped by a thin adapter at `/static/yuzu-charts.js` that reads `--mds-color-chart-*` Yuzu design tokens at render time. Six chart-bearing demo definitions (vuln_scan, antivirus, bitlocker, firewall, certificates, os_info) ship as `InstructionSet demo.visualization.fleet-posture`, auto-imported on server startup.

### 28.2 Response Templates :white_check_mark: `T2`

Implemented. Named response view configurations stored per `InstructionDefinition` in a `response_templates_spec` JSON column. Synthesised `__default__` view from `spec.result.columns` or plugin schema. REST CRUD + dashboard View dropdown. See §20.6 for the full contract. Phase 8.2, issue #254.

### 28.3 Response Offloading :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped — this row duplicates §20.7 (same capability, filed under two domains during the original outline). See §20.7 for the full description: operator-registered offload targets, typed auth, CRLF-guarded headers, batching, `SecretCodec`-encrypted credentials at rest, REST CRUD at `/api/v1/offload-targets`. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/offload_routes.{hpp,cpp}`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started; the row is kept rather than deleted per the map's "mark, don't remove" convention.)*

### 28.4 TAR Dashboard Page :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

In progress (Phase 15.A retention + 15.D SQL frame; the **15.H process tree viewer shipped 2026-06-18**). A dedicated `/tar` page off the main dashboard nav. Surfaces, in one place, every operator-facing TAR affordance: ad-hoc SQL against agent warehouses with scope-walking-aware results (`save as result set` for downstream narrowing), retention awareness across the fleet, and the **shipped** process tree viewer (Frame 3, §28.5). The consolidation makes TAR — the headline forensics + inventory capability — a discoverable destination rather than a fragment scattered across other pages. Design: `docs/tar-dashboard.md`.

### 28.5 TAR Process Tree Viewer :white_check_mark: `T2`

Shipped 2026-06-18 (Phase 15.H, [#554](https://github.com/Tr3kkR/Yuzu/issues/554)). Reconstructs a per-host process tree entirely from that host's **local TAR warehouse** (`$Process_Live` + `$TCP_Live`, via the read-only `tar.sql` action) — **no seed**, no `/proc`/`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`/`proc_listallpids` walk, no server-side mirror, no live process probe. The tree is built server-side in C++ from the flat event stream (recursive CTEs are blocked on the agent). Renders as a collapsible two-column tree + sticky detail panel (path, user, start time, connections, anomaly evidence on row click), with an inline remote-`IP:port` summary per row, same-name sibling grouping (`name ×N`), and client-side All/Running/Exited + anomalies-only + text filters. Timescale is a preset (On boot · On agent install · Last minute · Last 10m · Last hour · Last day) or a custom From/To (UTC) window — **not** `?as_of`. A name-based heuristic flags suspicious parent→child spawns (office/browser → shell/LOLBin). Honest in-page limitations: **no seed** → a process whose `started` event aged out of the live cap (or predates the oldest retained row) may not appear; **Windows is names-only** (ETW Kernel-Process — no per-process path/command line; populated on Linux/macOS); "On boot"/"On agent install" are TAR-derived proxies. Viewing the frame needs `Infrastructure:Read`; reconstruction dispatches a live `tar.sql` so it additionally requires `Execution:Execute` + the device's management scope, and the detail cache is keyed by a CSPRNG token bound to the originating operator. This is a deliberate deviation from the original seed-snapshot design (it drops the agent service-install-hardening dependency). REST/MCP parity (`GET /api/v1/tar/process-tree/{id}`) is a tracked follow-up ([#1562](https://github.com/Tr3kkR/Yuzu/issues/1562)). Design: `docs/tar-dashboard.md` §5.

### 28.6 Retention Awareness Surface :white_check_mark: `T2`

Shipped (Phase 15.A). Operator-facing aggregate view of every device × source pair where `<source>_enabled=false` — the operational consequence of issue #539's per-source retention pause. Surfaces "paused since" timestamp, live-row count, oldest timestamp; supports one-click re-enable (per-source, the #539 invariant) and a typed-hostname-confirmation purge (agent action `tar.purge_source`, `Infrastructure:Delete`) for the "we have what we need, drop the rows but keep the collector paused" case. Without this surface, operators who disabled a collector for forensic preservation have no way to know which boxes are accumulating non-aging data. Design: `docs/tar-dashboard.md` §3.

### 28.7 Fleet Topology 3D Visualization :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Further along than the original 11-PR estimate (`feat/viz-engine` branch, merged to dev 2026-05-15). `/viz/fleet` page renders the fleet as translucent cubes (one per agent) with interior process dots coloured by category (`system`, `browser`, `database`, `web`, `runtime`, `other`). Backed by an aggregating `FleetTopologyStore` (60s LRU-of-2 cache, single-flight refill) producing a `fleet_topology.v1` JSON envelope. REST: `GET /api/v1/viz/fleet/topology` + HTMX fragment `/fragments/viz/fleet/topology`. WASD/orbit/zoom camera, hostname `Sprite` labels, hover tooltip with raycaster, kill switch (`--viz-disable` / `YUZU_VIZ_DISABLE`), `machines_max` DoS cap (default 5000 / ceiling 100000), tier-before-permission ordering, audit actions `viz.fleet_topology` + `viz.fleet_topology.invalidate`. **Verified 2026-09-07: PRs 8 and 9 shipped** (intra-cube localhost edges + cross-machine/external edges — `docs/fleet-viz-invariants.md` "Edge invariants — PR 8", cross-machine edge code in `yuzu-viz.js`). **PR 10 shipped too, but scope changed**: it landed as `fleet_snapshot_json` push-ingestion (`FleetTopologyStore::push_snapshot()`, additive proto field on `HeartbeatRequest`) rather than the originally-planned vulnerability overlay — that overlay does not exist (zero hits for `mode=threat`/`ThreatGraph` in `yuzu-viz.js`; tracks with §28.8 staying Not Started). **PR 11 (LOD/InstancedMesh/scheduler polish) remains open** — only forward-looking comments in `yuzu-viz.js` reference it, no InstancedMesh migration landed. Design: `docs/plans/feat-viz-engine-plan-2026-05-09.md`. Standing invariants: `docs/fleet-viz-invariants.md`.

### 28.8 Threat Graph Mode :x: `T2`

Not implemented. Mode toggle on `/viz/fleet` (`?mode=threat` / `T` shortcut, persisted in `localStorage`) that overlays:
1. **Per-host IPC graph** — all same-host IPC channels, not just TCP loopback. New `EdgeKind` enum on `ConnectionEdge`: `TcpLoopback` (today), `UnixSocket`, `NamedPipe`, `SharedMemory`, `DBus`, `ALPC`, `EbpfMap`. Each renders with a distinct line style + colour. `world_accessible` boolean per edge surfaces a red glow on edges whose endpoints any process can join (Unix socket with `0666`, abstract socket, world-rw `/dev/shm`).
2. **Per-process posture overlay** — composite glyph synthesising vulnerability scan + AV status + signed-binary verification + firewall exposure + disk encryption into a single character (`!` warning, `⚠` high risk, `?` unknown, hidden when hardened). Sprite-child of each process Sphere, reuses PR 6 sprite infrastructure.
3. **Cross-host network graph** with TLS-termination annotation on listening sockets carrying cert subject / issuer / expiry; new `Containerised` scope classification for inter-container traffic on private RFC1918 / Docker default ranges.

Anti-Mythos framing: Yuzu is the defender's mirror of LLM-driven offensive enumeration; operators read the Threat Graph to decide where to insert controls (WAF, IPS, API gateway, VxLAN separation, firewall, network-parser hardening). Design: `docs/plans/threat-graph-roadmap.md`.

### 28.9 Defender Recommendation Engine :x: `T2`

Not implemented. An external **agentic AI worker** (running as a managed per-customer sprint cadence) consumes Threat Graph snapshots and produces hardening recommendations — "insert WAF here", "VxLAN-separate these services", "harden this network parser against direct injection" — posted to a new `recommendations.db` server store via REST + MCP using a service-scoped API token. Recommendations are ghost-overlaid in Threat mode; operators *accept* / *dismiss* / *apply* via the existing approval workflow (`workflows` store). "Apply" calls existing plugin actions (firewall rule add, etc.). Schema: `customer_id`, `generated_by`, `kind` (insert_waf / vxlan_separate / firewall_rule / harden_parser / kill_world_socket), `target_node_ids`, `target_edge_keys`, `rationale`, `status` (open / accepted / dismissed / applied), `yaml_source`. Design: `docs/plans/threat-graph-roadmap.md` § Recommendation engine.

Not implemented. `yuzu-sdk` Python package wrapping REST API v1 with async support and typed models.

## 30. Scope Walking & Result Sets

*The Yuzu product differentiator. Operator working memory is finite; the IT estate is a finite-state automaton with mutating state-table size and mutating per-row state. Real-time discovery via iterative scope narrowing — every query produces a device set that becomes the input scope for the next query or action — is the only realistic interaction model at fleet scale. Reference walkthrough: the Chrome incident-response scenario in `docs/scope-walking-design.md` §10.*

### 30.1 Result Set Persistence and Lineage :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped 2026-05-31 (Phase 15.B; `68427bba`). **Update 2026-09-07: `result_set_store.{cpp,hpp}` is now PostgreSQL** — the Postgres-migration ladder item this row originally flagged is done (verified via `PGconn`/`pg::` usage in `result_set_store.cpp`; part of the broader server-store migration, see §38). The REST surface lives in `rest_api_v1.cpp`. A named, TTL-bounded set of device IDs produced by a query, action result, or operator-curated list — the unit of composable scope. Stable identity (`rs_<ulid>`), optional human-readable per-operator alias, immutable lineage edges that record the chain of `(parent_result_set, narrowing_query)` back to a ground set, source-payload JSON sufficient to live-re-evaluate the producing query without operator re-input. Persisted in the `result_set_store` PostgreSQL schema (ADR-0036; formerly `result_sets.db`) with `ON DELETE CASCADE` member rows; pinning extends TTL beyond the default 1 hour for incident-response sessions; per-operator quotas (10K result sets, 50 pins) and a 5-minute background GC sweep prevent runaway scripts from filling the table. REST: `/api/v1/result-sets/...` covering create-from-inventory/tar/instruction, members, lineage, pin/unpin/re-eval, delete. Audit row per state transition for forensic reconstruction. Design: `docs/scope-walking-design.md` §3, §6, §9.

### 30.2 Composable Scope from Previous Query :white_check_mark: `T2`

Shipped 2026-05-31 (Phase 15.C; `68427bba`, hardening `4f10a69b`). The Scope Engine grammar gains a third short-circuit kind, `from_result_set:<id-or-alias>`, alongside the existing `__all__` and `group:<name>`. Composes with attribute predicates via `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` so a result set can be the candidate set and the predicate is a real-time refinement against current device attributes. Stale members (offline > 24h, decommissioned, removed from management group) are silently dropped at resolve time with a dashboard-surfaced warning rather than failing the query — operators iterating an IR chain need progress, not a stop, and the audit row records the dropped IDs for forensic completeness. Dashboard surfacing: persistent left-rail sidebar of the operator's active result sets, chain breadcrumb above every query frame mirroring the lineage, scope chip in every query/instruction/policy frame for one-click rebinding. Design: `docs/scope-walking-design.md` §4, §8.

### 30.3 YAML DSL `fromResultSet:` Surface :white_check_mark: `T2`

Shipped 2026-05-31 (Phase 15.E; `e6361a3a`). Instruction/instruction-set paths done; **Policy `fromResultSet:` deferred to PR-E2** (result-set TTL vs. continuous policy evaluation). The `scope:` block in `InstructionDefinition`, `InstructionSet`, and `Policy` gains `fromResultSet:` as a mutually-exclusive (or composable-with-`selector:`) alternative form so YAML-defined automation can target the device set produced by a previous query. Validation rules: `fromResultSet + assignment.managementGroups` rejected at YAML load (a result set already has a fixed device set, layering management-group filtering on top is redundant); `fromResultSet` requires `assignment.mode = static` (the whole point of a result set is a fixed target — `dynamic` re-evaluation against management groups would defeat it). Resolution at instruction *invocation* time, not YAML load time, so a definition carrying `fromResultSet:` is valid YAML even if the referenced set has expired by invocation. Resolution failure surfaces as `INSTRUCTION_SCOPE_RESOLUTION_FAILED` with the result-set ID and reason in the audit row. Design: `docs/scope-walking-design.md` §7.

### 30.4 Result Set Operational Hardening :large_orange_diamond: `T2`

Largely shipped (Phase 15.G). Shipped: live re-eval (sibling result set), background GC sweep (`ResultSetStore::gc_sweep()` wired in `server.cpp`), per-operator quota/pin caps (`429`/`409`), and Prometheus `yuzu_result_sets_total` / `yuzu_result_sets_alive` / `yuzu_result_set_gc_total` / `yuzu_result_set_quota_rejected`. Remaining: the `yuzu_result_set_resolve_seconds` histogram and a final audit-polish pass. Live re-evaluation produces a *new* result set ID rooted at the original's parent (sibling, not child) — operators can refresh a stale set against current estate state without breaking lineage. Background GC sweep every 5 minutes removes unpinned sets past TTL, cascading to member rows. Per-operator quotas enforced with `429 RESULT_SET_QUOTA` and `409 PIN_LIMIT`. Prometheus metrics — `yuzu_result_sets_total`, `yuzu_result_sets_alive`, `yuzu_result_set_resolve_seconds` histogram by cardinality bucket, GC counter, quota-rejection counter — surface health and runaway-script detection. Audit polish on every state transition. Design: `docs/scope-walking-design.md` §3.3, §9.

## 31. System Guardian — Real-Time Agent-Side Guaranteed State

*The agent-side primitive that makes guaranteed state **operationally true** rather than approximately true. PolicyStore (§16) evaluates desired-state rules on a poll-based schedule — typical 5-minute cadence. For security-sensitive settings ("this firewall port must never be open," "this registry value must never change," "this EDR process must always run") a 5-minute window is unacceptable. System Guardian uses **kernel-backed user-mode notification APIs** to detect drift within microseconds of it occurring, remediate it, and journal the event — even when the server is unreachable, even before any user has logged in. This is the headline parity feature against the leading commercial endpoint-management platforms' real-time enforcement engines. Agent runs in user space as SYSTEM (Windows) / root (Linux) / privileged daemon (macOS); no kernel drivers required. Design: `docs/yuzu-guardian-design-v1.1.md`. Windows-first delivery: `docs/yuzu-guardian-windows-implementation-plan.md`.*

### 31.1 Guardian Engine and Wire Protocol :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Shipped — well beyond the PRs 1-2 status this row originally recorded. Agent-side `GuardianEngine` (`agents/core/src/guardian_engine.{hpp,cpp}`) with two-phase startup — `start_local()` pre-network so enforcement is active before the Register RPC, then `sync_with_server()` post-Register. KV namespace `__guardian__` for cached policy. Reserved plugin name `__guard__` intercepted in `agent.cpp` before the plugin match loop (load-time rejection in `plugin_loader.cpp` for defence in depth). Wire contract: `proto/yuzu/guardian/v1/guaranteed_state.proto` with `GuaranteedStateRule`, `GuaranteedStatePush`, `GuaranteedStateEvent`, `GuaranteedStateStatus`, `GuaranteedStateRuleStatus`. Server store: PostgreSQL schema `guaranteed_state_store` (ADR-0038; formerly `guaranteed-state.db`) with immutable event log, plus the `BaselineStore` deployment model (`server/core/src/baseline_store.{hpp,cpp}`) — a **Baseline** is the only deployable unit; push fan-out + heartbeat reconcile gate on `deployed_member_rule_ids()` sourced from each deploy's `deployed_snapshot`, not the live member set (`docs/guardian-baseline-model.md`). **Also verified 2026-09-07: ADR-0021 Spark is wired as Guardian's first consumer** — `agents/core/src/agent.cpp:1255` calls `wire_spark_engine()`, and `GuardianEngine::reconcile_rule_locked()` is the sole per-rule arm/disarm chokepoint enforcing mutual exclusion between legacy `IGuard` and `spark_runtime_`. `prefer_spark_` defaults **false** (confirmed in `guardian_engine.cpp` comments), so Spark is wired but inert — legacy `IGuard` remains the sole *live* enforcement path; this does not change any guard row's grade below, since none of them currently attribute live enforcement to Spark. Actions: `push_rules`, `get_status`.

### 31.2 Event Guards — Kernel-Event-Driven Enforcement (Windows) :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. **Corrected 2026-09-08 (governance sec-H1/sec-H2/UP-1):** of the four *originally-designed* Windows kernel-backed user-mode guards, **2 of 4 are live and remediation-capable** — Registry Guard and SCM Guard. A bonus File Guard shipped alongside them (not one of the original 4) but is **detection-only**, per its own source comment: `agents/core/src/guard_file.cpp:18` — "Detection-only: a FileGuard never writes (file-content remediation needs Content Distribution; deferred)." Enforce-promotion for the two remediation-capable guards is gated by the single `dangerous_enforce_in_spec` chokepoint (`server/core/src/guardian_rule_spec.cpp:303`):
- **Registry Guard** — shipped, detect + remediate (`agents/core/src/guard_registry.cpp` legacy path, `spark_registry.cpp` Spark-mechanism path). `RegNotifyChangeKeyValue` + `WaitForMultipleObjects` (~0 ms latency); the canonical "registry value must equal X" enforcer.
- **SCM Guard** — shipped, detect + remediate (`agents/core/src/guard_service.cpp`, `spark_service.cpp`). `NotifyServiceStatusChange` (~0 ms latency); enforces "service must remain running/stopped/disabled."
- **File Guard** — shipped, **detect-only, no remediation** (`agents/core/src/guard_file.cpp`, `spark_file.cpp`); not one of the original 4-guard design, delivered alongside it.
- **WFP Guard** — Not implemented. `FwpmFilterSubscribeChanges0` (~0 ms latency); defence-in-depth filter monitor for firewall posture. *(Verified 2026-09-07: no `FwpmFilterSubscribeChanges` call sites in `agents/core/src`.)*
- **ETW Guard** — Not implemented. `OpenTrace` / `ProcessTrace` (~1-5 ms latency); the multiplexed event provider with shared-session pooling per `docs/yuzu-guardian-design-v1.1.md` §8.3 (mandatory because Windows caps system-wide ETW sessions at 64, shared with Defender / EDR). *(Verified 2026-09-07: no `ProcessTrace`/`OpenTrace`/ETW-guard call sites anywhere in `agents/core/src`.)*

**Corrected 2026-09-08 (sec-H1):** the row previously claimed each guard implements a `self_test()` sentinel-probe mechanism on start; that symbol does not exist anywhere in `agents/core` (`grep -rn self_test agents/core` → 0 hits). The real mechanism is the opposite of a self-test: `GuardianEngine::get_status()` (`agents/core/src/guardian_engine.cpp:786`) reports every rule **conservatively fail-closed** — `compliant_rules=0`, `drifted_rules=0`, every rule counted `errored` — because, per the code's own comment, "`guard_healthy` is a RESERVED wire field whose safe default is 'unknown' (false)... until a real self-test / last-remediation signal exists (deferred...)". So there is no kernel-wiring health probe today; the engine deliberately under-reports rather than claim health it can't prove (consistent with §31.9's "Missing: kernel-wiring health indicator"). Resilience strategies (`Fixed`, `Backoff`, `Escalation`) live in `resilience_strategy.cpp`.

### 31.3 Condition Guards — Periodic Evaluation (All Platforms) :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. `spark_interval.cpp` ships a periodic-evaluation mechanism and the Linux service run-state guard (`make_service_guard()` in `agents/core/src/guard_systemd.cpp`, header `agents/core/include/yuzu/agent/guard_systemd.hpp`; Linux-only, §31.4) is a shipped instance of it, plus `spark_disk.cpp` (a disk-condition guard not in the original design). The originally-scoped process/WMI/software/compliance condition guards remain open: Hybrid Process Guard (`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` ETW + `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` poll safety net), WMI Guard (arbitrary WMI queries against an evaluator), Software Guard (Registry Uninstall keys + WMI freshness), Compliance Guard (Event Log queries) — none of these four found in `agents/core/src`.

### 31.4 Event Guards — Linux :large_orange_diamond: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

**Partial.** The **systemd service guard** (`SystemdServiceGuard`, `guard_systemd.{hpp,cpp}`) ships: `org.freedesktop.systemd1` `PropertiesChanged` subscriptions over sd-bus watch a unit's `ActiveState` ("sshd.service must remain running"), **observe-only** in v1 — drift is detected and reported (`platform=linux`); enforcement (mask/stop) is deferred to a polkit-gated change. The remaining Linux event-guard primitives are roadmap:
- **Inotify Guard** — `inotify_add_watch` for file/directory state assertions (config files, certificate files, sshd config).
- **Netlink Guard** — `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` for process-tree and device-event monitoring.
- **D-Bus / systemd Guard** — service-state observation **shipped** (above); enforcement + non-systemd fallback remain roadmap.
- **Audit Guard** — Linux audit subsystem (`auditd`) consumer for syscall-level assertions.
- **Sysctl Guard** — periodic check + `/proc/sys/...` write remediation; monitors kernel parameters that drift would indicate compromise.

The systemd service guard landed ahead of the rest of the Linux track (the motivating "keep SSH off" case); the remaining primitives stay gated on the Windows track soaking in production.

### 31.5 Event Guards — macOS :x: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Not implemented (PR 17). macOS equivalents using Apple's Endpoint Security (ES) framework — *requires the ES entitlement*, which is a notarised-build / DDM-distributed entitlement that Apple grants per-bundle-ID. Without ES, the macOS guard surface is reduced to `fseventsd`, `launchd` plist polling, and `kqueue` file-watch. Phase 16 macOS delivery is gated on (a) Windows + Linux soak and (b) ES entitlement availability.

### 31.6 State Evaluator and Remediation Engine :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. **Corrected 2026-09-08 (governance sec-H2):** Registry/service drift detection **+ remediation** are live behind the `dangerous_enforce_in_spec` denylist chokepoint (`server/core/src/guardian_rule_spec.cpp:303` — confirmed handles `registry-value-equals` and `service-stopped` denials for H1 registry-persistence keys and critical-service stops such as `rpcss`/`dcomlaunch`/the agent's own service). **File is detection-only** — `guard_file.cpp:18` states plainly "a FileGuard never writes"; the chokepoint above covers registry/service only, not file, because there is no file-remediation code path to gate. The decide/emit evaluation core (`agents/core/src/guardian_rule_eval.{hpp,cpp}`) computes `compliant | drift | exempt`-style verdicts per guard type with debounce/recovery-edge handling, but it is wired to the shipped guard types (registry/service remediation-capable, file detect-only), **not** the fully general assertion registry the original design specified (`firewall-port-blocked`, `process-running`, `file-hash-equals`, `kernel-param-equals`, `plist-key-equals` are not found in `agents/core/src`). Remediation methods are **system calls only — no shell-out** for the two remediation-capable guards (per design §14). *(Evidence: `guardian_rule_spec.cpp`, `guardian_rule_eval.cpp`, `guard_file.cpp:18`; verified 2026-09-07/08 — previously mis-graded Not Started, then over-stated file remediation.)*

### 31.7 Audit Journal and Server Store :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

**Regraded 2026-09-08 (governance sre-H1): Done → Partial — implemented, inert by default.** Server store shipped and live: `server/core/src/guaranteed_state_store.{hpp,cpp}`, PostgreSQL schema `guaranteed_state_store` (ADR-0038), immutable event log, no FK cascade on rule delete so historical events persist for forensic review. The **agent-side** journal/outbox-drain machinery is fully implemented under renamed files from the original plan's `guard_audit.{hpp,cpp}`: `guardian_lifecycle_journal.cpp` + `guardian_journal_format.cpp` (local journal + wire format) and `guardian_outbox_drain_worker.cpp` (the drain-to-server worker), all confirmed compiled in `agents/core/meson.build` — **but it is entirely gated on `prefer_spark_`, which defaults `false` in production**: `GuardianEngine::persist_lifecycle_journal_locked()` (`agents/core/src/guardian_engine.cpp:421`) returns immediately `if (!prefer_spark_ || !spark_runtime_ || !lifecycle_journal_)`, and `GuardianEngine::journal_age_stats()` (`guardian_engine.cpp:567`) likewise returns `std::nullopt` at `!prefer_spark_`. So today, with Spark inert (per §31.1), **no drift/remediation event is journaled or drained to the server through this path in production — its counters are provably zero.** The legacy (live) `IGuard` enforcement path has no equivalent push-journal of its own; `GuardianEngine::sync_with_server()` (`guardian_engine.cpp:325`) only logs a connection message today, it does not drain any event queue (that claim in an earlier draft of this row, citing `CommandResponse{plugin:"__guard__",action:"event"}`, no longer matches the code). The only live signal from the legacy path is the poll-based `get_status()` (§31.2's fail-closed reporting). *(Evidence: `guardian_engine.cpp:325,421,567`; verified 2026-09-08 — previously mis-graded Done.)*

### 31.8 Pre-Login Activation and Offline Capability :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Pre-login activation works by construction today: the agent runs as a Windows service with `SERVICE_AUTO_START` + `FailureActions` configured at install time (`agents/core/src/main.cpp:536`, `:602-609`, and `agents/core/src/service_win.{hpp,cpp}` for the SCM `ServiceMain`/control-handler dispatcher that actually makes `sc start` succeed — #1822); systemd unit on Linux with `Type=notify` + `Restart=always`; launchd `KeepAlive=true` + `RunAtLoad=true` on macOS. `GuardianEngine::start_local()` runs before the Register RPC, so with the registry/SCM guards shipped (§31.2; the file guard is detect-only, `guard_file.cpp:18`) enforcement begins as soon as the service starts — before any user can log in. Offline capability comes from caching policy in `kv_store.db` under `__guardian__` namespace; enforcement continues with last-known-good rules when the server is unreachable, and queued events flush when the server returns. Marked `:white_check_mark:` because the service-install side is operational (genuinely so as of #1822 — before it, `sc start YuzuAgent` failed with error 1053 on every real Windows install, so this claim was aspirational, not true, until this fix landed); the *enforcement* half now rests on the shipped registry/SCM guards in §31.2/§31.6 (file: detection only; re-verified 2026-09-07 — this sentence previously still said "gated on PR 3+").

### 31.9 Dashboard and Approval Workflow :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Partial. The Guardian dashboard shipped at `/guardian` (`server/core/src/guardian_page_ui.cpp`, `guardian_ui.cpp` — not the originally-planned `/guaranteed-state` path) with the Baseline draft/deployed lifecycle (deploys are `Push`-gated; editing a deployed Baseline's members reaches agents only via a re-deploy snapshot rewrite — `docs/guardian-baseline-model.md`). **Missing:** the kernel-wiring health indicator (`guard_healthy` + `last_notification` "deaf vs. compliant" distinction) and the full HTMX rule editor (CRUD + YAML validation + conflict detection) called for in the original design §10. Approval-workflow reuse of the existing `ApprovalManager` not independently re-verified this session. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/guardian_page_ui.cpp`, `guardian_ui.cpp`; verified 2026-09-07 — previously mis-graded Not Started.)*

### 31.10 Rule Signing and Quarantine Integration :x: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Not implemented (PRs 12, 15). HMAC rule signing (HKDF per design §11.2) with per-tenant key stored in `CredWrite`/`CredRead` (Windows), Linux Secret Service / kernel keyring (Linux), Keychain (macOS); agent-side signature validation before activating a rule prevents unauthenticated rule injection. Quarantine integration: WFP block-all filter at weight 65535 (Windows) or `iptables` / `nftables` rule (Linux) drops all traffic except Yuzu's own; instruction handlers `quarantine.add_exception | remove_exception | lift`; server-side DNS resolution; resilience reset on lift so a remediation storm doesn't carry over. *(Re-verified 2026-09-07: still absent — `guardian_rule_spec.cpp:394`'s own comment says "full RFC-8785 canonicalisation lands with rule signing", i.e. not yet; no `sign`/`HMAC`-keyed rule-activation code found in `guardian_rule_spec.*`, `baseline_store.*`, or `guardian_engine.*`. Grade unchanged.)*

## 32. DEX — Digital Employee Experience

*Endpoint-experience observation, performance analytics, and upgrade evidence. Shipped 2026-Q2 on the Guardian ingest path (§31.7); previously unmapped in this file.

Server-side N-distinct-device incident detector (`server/core/src/dex_blast_radius.{hpp,cpp}`) firing an alert webhook; per-signal operator routing (`dex_alert_router.{hpp,cpp}`).

### 32.5 Upgrade Evidence — Cohort-Paired Before/After Comparison :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`/auto` Verify (§36.3): pure compare engine (`server/core/src/app_perf_compare.{hpp,cpp}`), cohort reader (`app_perf_cohort_reader.hpp`, `app_perf_group_reader.{hpp,cpp}`), REST `/dex/perf/compare` surface confirmed present. Evidential — no verdict/threshold, per `verify_routes.cpp` (§36.3). Deliberately **no floor suppression here**, unlike the fleet/group reads in §32.6: `kDexCohortFloor` only sets the honest `small_cohort` flag (`app_perf_compare.cpp:190`; "NOT suppressed" per `app_perf_compare.hpp:34`), and the audited `dex.app_perf.compare` read replaces suppression (audit verb documented in `docs/user-manual/rest-api.md`; `verify_routes.cpp:132`).

### 32.6 Behavioral-PII Privacy Engineering :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Cohort-floor suppression on fleet/group app-perf reads (no singling-out below the floor) and audit-on-open per-device lenses (§21.6). *(Referenced from `docs/yuzu-guardian-design-v1.1.md` §24 invariants cited in `CLAUDE.md`; not independently re-derived this session.)*

### 32.7 Experience Scoring and Sentiment :x: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Not implemented — deliberately. Composite 0-100 experience scores (with sentiment surveys as an input) are a DEX-market pattern; Yuzu currently positions evidence-not-scores. Would additionally require the §14.4 survey primitive as an input (now shipped, but no scoring/sentiment engine consumes it).

## 33. Network Quality

*Measurement-first device/local-link health lens. Shipped 2026-06; previously unmapped in this file. Doc: `docs/user-manual/network.md`.*

### 33.1 Device Network Heartbeat Facts :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Interval retransmit rate, RTT, and throughput as thin `yuzu.net_*` heartbeat tags, sampled agent-side. *(Evidence: `agents/core/src/net_quality_sampler.{hpp,cpp}`, confirmed compiled in `agents/core/meson.build`. Windows retransmit is whole-stack + unvalidated per `CLAUDE.md`'s routed-concerns table — withheld from the fleet gauge, Linux-only today.)*

### 33.2 Fleet Network Gauges :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`yuzu_fleet_net_*` gauges with a per-OS label (never blended cross-OS, per the routed-concerns invariant). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/network_perf_model.{hpp,cpp}`, `network_perf_rules.hpp`.)*

### 33.3 `/network` Dashboard :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Fleet and per-device network-health page. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/network_routes.{hpp,cpp}`, `network_ui.cpp`.)*

### 33.4 Degraded Classification and Per-Destination Localization :x: `T3` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Deferred — `yuzu.net_degraded` is retired per the routed-concerns table (gauge absent-not-zero); a hard degraded threshold needs a real-fleet baseline first.

---

## 34. Device Pages and Live Snapshot

*The shared per-device surface (`/devices` + `/device?id=`). Shipped 2026-06; previously unmapped in this file. Doc: `docs/user-manual/device-management.md`.*

### 34.1 Fleet List and Device Entity Page :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`/devices` + `/device?id=` with Device info / DEX / Guardian lens tabs. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/device_routes.{hpp,cpp}`, `device_ui.cpp`.)*

### 34.2 Live Snapshot ("Get live info") :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Dispatch-and-poll card grid (process tree, services, users, netconfig, ARP/DNS on Windows, listening/connections, capture sources) with a per-kind `device.live.<kind>` audit verb, gated on `Execution:Execute`.

### 34.3 Agentic REST Parity for Device Surfaces :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

REST parity for the live-snapshot kinds, funneling behavioural-PII reads through the `emit_behavioral_audit` chokepoint (§21.6) — except the REST `device.live.*` route itself, still an inline bool-capture (tracked under #1647, open; #1703 was closed unverified in the 2026-07-14 backlog reset — the gap is confirmed live at `rest_api_v1.cpp:10535`) — fail-closed 503 + `Sec-Audit-Failed` when the audit row cannot persist. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/rest_audit.hpp`.)*

---

## 35. Agent Daily-Sync Inventory (ADR-0016)

*Per-source endpoint state pushed daily over `ReportInventory`, hash-skip on no change. Shipped 2026-06; previously unmapped in this file. Docs: `docs/adr/0016-agent-daily-sync-framework.md`, `docs/user-manual/inventory.md`.*

### 35.1 Sync Framework :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`SyncScheduler` (`agents/core/src/sync_scheduler.{hpp,cpp}`) + `LocalDispatcher` (`local_dispatcher.cpp`) — stable per-agent phase spread, hash-skip when unchanged, server `need_full` resend. Shared ingestion seam wired identically on the direct and gateway paths. All confirmed compiled in `agents/core/meson.build`.

### 35.2 Installed-Software Inventory :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Source #1 (`agents/core/src/sync_source_installed_software.{hpp,cpp}`) → born-on-Postgres `SoftwareInventoryStore` (`server/core/src/software_inventory_store.{hpp,cpp}`), normalized rows, server-receipt freshness per the #1685 clock-skew rule. `Inventory` RBAC securable.

### 35.3 Device CI (Hardware/OS Identity) :large_orange_diamond: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Source #3 (`agents/core/src/sync_source_device_ci.{hpp,cpp}`) → born-on-Postgres `DeviceInventoryStore` (`server/core/src/device_inventory_store.{hpp,cpp}`) — serial/UUID/MAC, GDPR-personal-data / works-council-relevant per CLAUDE.md's routed-concerns table. Full read-surface + CMDB correlation not independently re-verified this session (inherits Partial from the 2026-07 review).

### 35.4 Software Catalogue and `/inventory` Dashboard :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Background catalogue rollup (`server/core/src/software_catalog_rollup.{hpp,cpp}`, cross-referenced from §26.3/§27.1) feeding the `/inventory` dashboard page (`inventory_ui.cpp`).

### 35.5 Multi-Source Consolidation :x: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Not implemented — connector-fed sources and identity-merge consolidation remain the §25/§26 gap; confirmed no `Repository`/consolidation model exists (§26.1/26.2 stay Not Started).

Sources #2 (app_perf) and licensing also confirmed present but out of this domain's scope: `agents/core/src/sync_source_app_perf.{hpp,cpp}` feeds §32 DEX; `sync_source_software_licensing.{hpp,cpp}` feeds §27 SLE.

## 36. `/auto` — Operator Automation (Assess → Act → Verify)

*Pre-flight readiness, gated deployment, and paired-cohort verification. Shipped 2026-06; previously unmapped in this file. Doc: `docs/user-manual/preflight.md`.*

### 36.1 Pre-Flight Readiness (ASSESS) :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Born-on-Postgres `PreflightRunStore` (`server/core/src/preflight_run_store.{hpp,cpp}`) + background `PreflightRunner` (`preflight_runner.{hpp,cpp}`) re-dispatching read-only checks to a frozen cohort; `Infrastructure:Read` + `Execution:Execute` gated. *(Evidence: `preflight_eval.cpp`, `preflight_routes.cpp`, `preflight_ui.cpp`.)*

### 36.2 Deploy (ACT) :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Stage+execute on the go-cohort via `content_dist`; born-on-Postgres `DeploymentRunStore` (`server/core/src/deployment_run_store.{hpp,cpp}`) with guarded one-way transitions and an execute-once CAS (per the ladder row in `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md`). *(Evidence: `deployment_engine.cpp`, `deployment_routes.cpp`, `deployment_ui.cpp`.)*

### 36.3 Verify (EVIDENCE) :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Cohort-paired app-perf before/after comparison (§32.5) closing the ASSESS→ACT→VERIFY loop. Evidential only — no verdict, threshold or gate, and deliberately no cohort floor (the audited compare read replaces suppression; see §32.5). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/verify_routes.{hpp,cpp}`.)*

---

## 37. Internal PKI / Certificate Authority

*Internal CA subsystem. Shipped 2026-05/06; previously represented only as a §1.1 gap note. Doc: `docs/pki-architecture.md`.*

### 37.1 Internal CA and Default Certificates :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`CaStore` (`server/core/src/ca_store.{hpp,cpp}`, PostgreSQL schema `ca_store` — ADR-0053, formerly `ca.db`; key material behind the `KeyProvider` seam, never in the DB); per-install default certs generated on first boot.

### 37.2 Per-Agent mTLS Identity :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Agent CSR at enrollment (`agent_csr.{hpp,cpp}`) → `sign_agent_csr` (`server/core/src/x509_ca.{hpp,cpp}`, server-chosen subject/SAN/EKU) → app-layer enforcement. Per CLAUDE.md's routed-concerns table, `sign_agent_csr` is the single shared signer for direct `Register` AND gateway `ProxyRegister`; revoke is serial-scoped.

### 37.3 CA Operations Surface :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

REST `/api/v1/ca/*` (public root/CRL by design — confirmed NOT in the TLS chain per the CLAUDE.md-cited PR #2479 finding). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/ca_routes.{hpp,cpp}`.)*

### 37.4 Subordinate-CA Mode :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Built-in root subordinated to an enterprise root: CSR export, chain import + validation. *(Inherits from the 2026-07 review; `CaMode::Subordinate` not independently re-verified this session.)*

### 37.5 Secure-by-Default Distribution :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

TLS-by-default images shipped (#1314, merged 2026-06-21). Management-plane SPKI peer-pin + serverAuth EKU + fail-closed boot guard shipped 2026-09-02 (#1422 closed via PR #3905). Residual, still open: management-plane certificate *revocation* (#3915) — the icon reflects the distribution mechanism, not that residual.

---

## 38. Server Storage Substrate — PostgreSQL

*ADR-0006/0007/0008/0010/0012 program: the server's storage substrate is PostgreSQL; the agent stays SQLite. Previously unmapped in this file (supersedes the §22.9 sharding strategy).*

### 38.1 Substrate and Pool :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

`server/core/src/pg/`: RAII connection/result/transaction wrappers, a bounded `PgPool` with lease-RAII, `PgMigrationRunner`, `yuzu_pg_*` metrics, `/readyz` conjunction.

### 38.2 Fail-Closed Flip :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

The server refuses to start without a reachable Postgres (no SQLite fallback, ADR-0007) — per `CLAUDE.md`'s routed-concerns table, this is a standing invariant enforced at boot.

### 38.3 Secrets at Rest :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Verify-only hashes or `SecretCodec`-envelope-encrypted blobs (ADR-0010) — never plaintext columns. 14 `*_store.cpp` files carry secret-shaped columns; only `webhook_store.cpp` among them was spot-checked this session (the other two checks below are a hash column and a route file) — the rest stand on their ADR-0010 migration-time `security-guardian` reviews, not on a re-audit here. Verified this session: `license_store.hpp` documents `license_key_hash` as a SHA-256 verify-only hash (§22.3); `offload_routes.cpp`'s `auth_credential` is `SecretCodec`-encrypted per its own row text (§20.7); `webhook_store.cpp`'s constructor takes a `pg::SecretCodec&` (its HMAC signing secret is envelope-encrypted, though the pre-existing §21.4 row text doesn't say so explicitly).

### 38.4 Store Migration Ladder :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

**Update 2026-09-07 — census re-run this session, corrects the 2026-07 review's "~27 legacy SQLite stores remain" figure:** `ls server/core/src/*_store.cpp` = 43 files; `grep -lE "PGconn|pg::" server/core/src/*_store.cpp` = 42 of them. The one non-match, `fleet_topology_store.cpp`, holds no direct DB handle of its own (composed from `AuditStore` + `NvdDatabase` reads) — it is not a SQLite store either. **Zero SQLite-only server stores remain.** The sole SQLite-*backed* store is `server/core/src/nvd_db.cpp` (not `*_store.cpp`-named, confirmed via `sqlite3_open_v2` call; the read-only legacy-file probes in `runtime_config_store.cpp` and `server.cpp:373` also open SQLite but persist nothing), grandfathered under ADR-1005 Phase 7 pending the vulnerability-management use-case engine (§9.4). Graded Done rather than Partial: the migration ladder itself is complete for every intended store; the one remaining SQLite user is a deliberate, documented, out-of-scope exception, not an unfinished migration.

## 39. Headless Platform — Engine Principals and On-Behalf-Of Authorization (ADR-1005) *(new domain, v4.0)*

*A distinct principal class for autonomous use-case engine (UCE) modules, and the interim rule that no ingress surface accepts a client-asserted on-behalf-of assertion until server-verifiable delegation ships. Not present in any prior version of this map. Doc: `docs/adr/1005-headless-platform-use-case-engines.md`.*

### 39.1 Engine Principal Store :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Born-on-Postgres `EnginePrincipalStore` (`server/core/src/engine_principal_store.{hpp,cpp}`, schema `engine_principal_store`) — a dedicated durable identity (owner, justification, classification, lifecycle) for an autonomous UCE module, separate from `ApiTokenStore` (no secret material lives here; credentials stay hash-only in `ApiTokenStore`). Fail-closed at construction and at the `get_for_auth` runtime chokepoint, which returns a three-state result (Active / not the binary alive-or-not a naive store would return). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/engine_principal_store.hpp` header; design: `docs/auth-engine-principals-design.md` §3.1.)*

### 39.2 Principal Class Metric Label :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

Closed-set `principal_class` label (`human` / `agent` / `none` / `engine`) for HTTP request metrics, resolved from the session's authenticated `principal_kind`/`auth_source` (not header presentation) — an engine-token request that fails resolution stays `agent`, never `engine`, so the label can't be spoofed by presenting a bearer token shaped like one. *(Evidence: `server/core/src/principal_class.hpp`; design: `docs/observability-conventions.md`.)*

### 39.3 On-Behalf-Of Assertion Guard :white_check_mark: `T2` *(verified 2026-09-07)*

The server rejects — not silently ignores — any on-behalf-of assertion on every ingress surface (REST, MCP, agent gRPC) until Phase 5 server-verifiable delegation ships; a rejected assertion is a hard error, so a header-stamping proxy fails loudly rather than silently impersonating. Per CLAUDE.md's routed-concerns table, the four health-probe paths are the sole exception (so a header-stamping proxy doesn't crash-loop the server). *(Evidence: `server/core/src/on_behalf_guard.hpp`.)*

## Appendix A: Plugin Coverage Matrix

*Category labels assigned 2026-09-07 (judgment call, matched to the pre-existing taxonomy below — no canonical category list exists in this file). The 8 rows added in the v4.0 re-baseline (`disk_actions`, `disk_space`, `filesystem_posture`, `license_scan`, `netprobe`, `power_health`, `rdp_control`, `tags`) are `ls`/meson-confirmed additions. *(verified 2026-09-07)*

**49 plugins** (+ 2 planned) — covering hardware, network, security, filesystem, registry, WMI, WiFi, WoL, IOC, quarantine, certificates, content distribution, user interaction, and more. Includes cross-platform and Windows-only plugins; the two test/debug plugins (`chargen`, `example`) appear in the table but are excluded from the headline count. Per-OS cells follow `docs/os-capability-matrix.md` (2026-09-07; a partial 🟡 leg is shown as Y — the matrix carries the per-action detail). Recount verified 2026-09-07 (`ls -d agents/plugins/*/` = 51 directories, minus `example` + `chargen` = 49; the previous "44" undercounted 8 shipped plugins — `disk_actions`, `disk_space`, `filesystem_posture`, `license_scan`, `netprobe`, `power_health`, `rdp_control`, `tags` — none of which were in the table). `software_usage` / `app_control` remain aspirational — confirmed no such directories exist under `agents/plugins/` as of this baseline.
