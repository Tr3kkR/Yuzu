# Tachyon 8.1 Parity Plan

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** 2026-03-30 | **Status:** Draft

This document analyzes 1e Tachyon 8.1 capabilities against Yuzu's current state (v0.7.0, 165/184 capabilities done) and defines a phased implementation plan to achieve feature parity.

---

## Part 1: Architectural Comparison

| Dimension | 1e Tachyon 8.1 | Yuzu v0.7.0 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Language** | C# / .NET (server), custom SCALE (agent) | C++23 (server+agent), Erlang/OTP (gateway) |
| **Agent Instruction Model** | SCALE scripting language (SQL + control flow) | Plugin ABI (C/C++ shared libraries) |
| **Wire Protocol** | WebSocket Secure (TCP 4000) | gRPC/Protobuf with mTLS |
| **Server Database** | SQL Server (multiple DBs) | SQLite (embedded, WAL mode) |
| **Scaling Architecture** | Switches (50K devices each, 5 per stack) | Erlang/OTP gateway (10K+ tested) |
| **Content Definition** | XML with XSD schema, digital signing | YAML with `yuzu.io/v1alpha1` DSL, Ed25519 signing |
| **Auth Model** | Windows AD (Kerberos), 2FA email | PBKDF2 sessions, OIDC/PKCE, API tokens, mTLS |
| **Content Delivery** | Background Channel (HTTPS) + Nomad P2P | HTTP content staging + execution |
| **Policy Engine — Server side** | Guaranteed State (SCALE-based check/fix) | PolicyStore with CEL expressions + triggers |
| **Policy Engine — Real-time agent-side enforcement** | Guaranteed State (kernel-event-driven enforcement, pre-login activation, offline-capable) | **System Guardian** — agent-side guard engine using kernel-backed user-mode APIs (RegNotifyChangeKeyValue, ETW, WFP, SCM on Windows; inotify/netlink/D-Bus on Linux; Endpoint Security on macOS). PRs 1-2 shipped (proto, server store, agent scaffolding); PR 3+ in flight per `docs/yuzu-guardian-windows-implementation-plan.md`. Phase 16 of the roadmap. |
| **API** | Consumer API (.NET SDK) | REST API v1 (70+ endpoints) + gRPC + MCP |
| **Dashboard** | ASP.NET web portal | HTMX server-rendered + SSE |
| **DMZ Support** | Dedicated DMZ Server (Response Stack) | Gateway node (Erlang, can be DMZ-deployed) |

### Key Architectural Differences

**Yuzu's advantages over Tachyon:**
- **No SQL Server dependency** — SQLite is embedded, zero-ops
- **Cross-platform from day one** — C++23 compiles on Win/Linux/macOS/ARM64
- **gRPC/Protobuf** — strongly typed, bidirectional streaming, native mTLS
- **MCP server** — AI-native fleet management (Tachyon has no equivalent)
- **Modern auth** — OIDC/PKCE, API tokens, session cookies (vs AD-only)
- **CEL for policy** — industry-standard expression language (vs proprietary SCALE)
- **Plugin ABI** — compiled native plugins are faster than interpreted SCALE
- **Erlang gateway** — OTP supervision trees, hot code upgrade, fault isolation

**Tachyon's advantages over Yuzu (gaps to close):**
- **SCALE language** — composable agent-side scripting with SQL, tables, control flow
- **Connector framework** — 12 bidirectional integrations (SCCM, Intune, ServiceNow, etc.)
- **Response visualization** — chart types, custom processors, server-side rendering
- **Software catalog** — normalized vendor/title/version with AI auto-curation
- **Nomad P2P** — peer-to-peer content distribution with bandwidth optimization
- **Consumer model** — formal third-party application integration framework
- **Inventory consolidation** — multi-source dedup, normalization, repositories
- **2FA for approvals** — email/token-based second factor
- **Survey/DND** — multi-question surveys, do-not-disturb suppression
- **PowerShell toolkit** — cmdlet library for scripted administration

### Gaps: Major Features Tachyon Has That Yuzu Lacks Entirely

These are significant capability areas not represented in Yuzu's capability map at all:

| # | Feature | Description | Impact |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| G1 | **Connector Framework** | Bidirectional data sync with SCCM, Intune, BigFix, ServiceNow, vCenter, WSUS, Oracle LMS, OpenLM, O365 | HIGH — core enterprise integration |
| G2 | **Response Visualization Engine** | Chart types (Pie, Bar, Column, Line, Area, SmartBar), built-in + custom processors, server-side rendering | MEDIUM — dashboard richness |
| G3 | **Software Catalog & Normalization** | Vendor/Title/Version/Edition normalization, AI auto-curation, 1E Catalog integration | HIGH — license compliance |
| G4 | **Inventory Repositories** | Multiple named repositories per type, connector-based population, consolidation/dedup/normalization | HIGH — multi-source inventory |
| G5 | **Software Usage Tracking** | Application usage categorization (Used/Rarely Used/Unused), metering data from agents | MEDIUM — license optimization |
| G6 | **Consumer Application Model** | Formal registration of third-party consumers with rate limits, offloading, custom data | MEDIUM — platform extensibility |
| G7 | **2FA for Approvals** | Email/token-based second factor on instruction approval | LOW — security hardening |
| G8 | **SCALE-like Composable Instructions** | Agent-side scripting with SQL, @tables, FOREACH, IF/ELSE, chained method calls | MEDIUM — instruction flexibility |
| G9 | **Data Offloading** | Route response data to external HTTP endpoints in real time | MEDIUM — analytics integration |
| G10 | **PowerShell Toolkit** | Cmdlet library wrapping the management API | LOW — admin convenience |
| G11 | **Branding / White-Label** | Custom logos, colors, names in dashboard | LOW — enterprise customization |
| G12 | **Process/Provider/Sync Logging** | Separate log views for sync jobs, provider operations, infrastructure | LOW — operational visibility |
| G13 | **Multi-Database Architecture** | Separate databases for responses, catalog, inventory, SLA, BI | MEDIUM — scale separation |
| G14 | **System Guardian — Real-Time Agent-Side Guaranteed State** | Tachyon's flagship: kernel-event-driven enforcement on Windows (RegNotifyChangeKeyValue, ETW, WFP, SCM), Linux (inotify, netlink, D-Bus, sysctl, audit), macOS (Endpoint Security, fseventsd, launchd). Pre-login activation. Fully offline-capable. Millisecond-level enforcement for event-driven rules. Auditable journal of every detection and remediation. **In flight** — PRs 1-2 shipped (proto, `guaranteed_state_store`, agent `GuardianEngine` scaffolding, `__guard__` dispatch hook); PR 3+ pending per `docs/yuzu-guardian-windows-implementation-plan.md`. PolicyStore alone does *not* deliver this — its 5-minute poll cycle is unacceptable for "this setting must never be in a non-compliant state" use cases (firewall ports, registry-backed security settings, EDR process always-running). Guardian is the agent-side primitive that closes that gap. | **CRITICAL** — this is the headline parity feature for enterprise endpoint management |

---

### Phase 13: Security Hardening & Operational Polish

*Close remaining security and operational gaps.*

**Duration estimate: 1 sprint**

| Issue | Title | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 13.1 | 2FA for Instruction Approval | Server |
| 13.2 | Composable Instruction Chains (SCALE-equivalent) | Agent + Server |
| 13.3 | Process / Sync Logging UI | Server |
| 13.4 | Dashboard Branding | Server |
| 13.5 | MCP Phase 2 (Write Tools) | Server |

**13.1 — 2FA for Instruction Approval**
- TOTP (RFC 6238) second factor for approval workflow
- Per-user TOTP secret stored encrypted in auth store
- QR code enrollment via Settings UI
- Approval endpoint requires `totp_code` parameter when 2FA is enabled
- Fallback: email-based one-time code (requires SMTP config)

**13.2 — Composable Instruction Chains**
This is the closest Yuzu can get to Tachyon's SCALE language without building an interpreter. The approach: server-side multi-step instruction composition using the existing WorkflowEngine.

- Workflow definitions in YAML with step chaining:
  ```yaml
  kind: Workflow
  spec:
    steps:
      - instruction: os_info.get_summary
        output_as: os_data
      - instruction: windows_updates.installed
        condition: "os_data.os_type == 'windows'"
        output_as: patches
      - instruction: script_exec.run_text
        parameters:
          language: PowerShell
          script_text: |
            $patches = ConvertFrom-Json '${patches.output}'
            # ... process patches
  ```
- Variables from previous steps available via `${step_name.field}` interpolation
- CEL conditions for conditional execution
- This provides SCALE-equivalent composability without a new scripting language

**13.3 — Process / Sync Logging UI**
- Dashboard page: `/monitoring`
- Tabs: Connector Sync Log, Scheduled Executions, Infrastructure Log
- Reuse existing AuditStore with category filtering
- HTMX fragments with 30s auto-refresh

**13.4 — Dashboard Branding**
- `BrandingConfig`: logo_url, product_name, primary_color, accent_color
- Stored in RuntimeConfigStore
- Settings UI: branding section with preview
- CSS variables for theme customization

**13.5 — MCP Phase 2 (Write Tools)**
- 6 write/execute tools: `set_tag`, `delete_tag`, `execute_instruction`, `approve_request`, `reject_request`, `quarantine_device`
- Approval workflow integration for destructive operations
- SSE streaming for execution progress

| 14.4 | vCenter Connector | Server |
| 14.5 | Additional Connectors (BigFix, O365, Oracle) | Server |
| 14.6 | High Availability (Active-Passive) | Server |

**14.1 — P2P Content Distribution**

**14.2 — Multi-Gateway Topology**
- Server supports multiple gateway registrations
- Gateway affinity: agents assigned to nearest gateway via latency probing
- Gateway failover: agents reconnect to alternate gateway on failure
- Topology view shows all gateways with agent counts

**14.3 — Database Sharding**
- Response data partitioned by time (monthly SQLite files)
- Automatic file rotation and TTL cleanup
- Query router spans partitions transparently
- Reduces WAL contention for high-throughput response collection

**14.4 — vCenter Connector**
- VMware vSphere API integration
- Sync: VMs, ESXi hosts, datastores, clusters, resource pools
- VM-to-agent correlation via hostname or UUID
- Virtual summary reporting (physical hosts, guest count, density)

**14.5 — Additional Connectors**
- BigFix: REST API integration for inventory sync
- Office 365: Microsoft Graph for license/usage data
- Oracle LMS: Database query for Oracle deployment facts

**14.6 — High Availability**

| **8: Visualization** | HIGH | Small | HIGH | Closes visible UX gap |
| **9: Connectors** | CRITICAL | Large | CRITICAL | #1 gap — every enterprise RFP asks for this |
| **10: Catalog** | HIGH | Medium | HIGH | License compliance is a primary use case |
| **11: Consumer** | MEDIUM | Medium | MEDIUM | Platform extensibility |
| **12: Agent Caps** | MEDIUM | Medium | LOW-MEDIUM | Completes capability map to 184/184 |
| **13: Polish** | MEDIUM | Medium | MEDIUM | Security + operational maturity |
| **14: Scale** | LOW | Large | HIGH (at scale) | Only needed for 100K+ deployments |
| **15: TAR Dashboard & Scope Walking** | HIGH | Medium | HIGH | Composable scope is Yuzu's product differentiator; Tachyon has no equivalent — TAR page also unifies retention awareness and process-tree forensics |
| **16: System Guardian** | **CRITICAL** | Large | **CRITICAL** | **The headline Tachyon parity feature** — real-time agent-side guaranteed state. Without this, "policy engine equivalent" is an overclaim. PR ladder defined; first 2 PRs shipped. |

### Recommended Execution Order

```
Phase 8 (Visualization) ──── 1 sprint ──── Immediate visual impact
    │
Phase 9 (Connectors) ─────── 2 sprints ─── Biggest enterprise gap
    │
Phase 10 (Catalog) ────────── 1 sprint ──── Builds on 9.8 normalization
    │
Phase 12 (Agent Caps) ─────── 1 sprint ──── Close capability map to 100%
    │ (parallel)
Phase 11 (Consumer) ────────── 1 sprint ──── Platform extensibility
    │
Phase 13 (Polish) ──────────── 1 sprint ──── Security + UX
    │
Phase 14 (Scale) ───────────── 2 sprints ─── Large deployment readiness
    │
Phase 15 (TAR + Scope Walking) ─ 2 sprints ─ Product differentiator (composable scope)
    │
Phase 16 (System Guardian) ──── 4-6 sprints ─ THE headline parity feature; PRs 1-2 done, PRs 3-17 in ladder
```

**Total estimated effort: ~15-17 sprints (Phases 8-16). Phase 16 is the longest single phase because real-time agent-side enforcement spans three OS platform-specific delivery tracks (Windows-first per `docs/yuzu-guardian-windows-implementation-plan.md`, then Linux, then macOS) and each kernel-event API integration is independently load-bearing.**

## Part 5: New Capability Map Entries

After all phases complete, the capability map would grow from 184 to ~225 capabilities:

| New Domain | Capabilities |
|-----------|-------------|
| 25. Connector Framework | Connector CRUD, Sync Engine, Connection Testing, Sync Scheduling, Sync Logging |
| 26. Inventory Repositories | Repository CRUD, Consolidation, Deduplication, Normalization, Multi-Source Merge |
| 27. Software Catalog | Catalog Store, Software Normalization, AI Curation (stub), Usage Tracking, License Entitlements |
| 28. Response Visualization | Chart Rendering, Built-in Processors, Custom Processors, Template Management, **TAR Dashboard Page** (Phase 15.A — Partial), **TAR Process Tree Viewer** (Phase 15.H), **Retention Awareness Surface** (Phase 15.A) |
| 29. Consumer Applications | Consumer Registration, Rate Limiting, Data Offloading, Custom Data |
| **30. Scope Walking & Result Sets** | Result Set Persistence and Lineage (15.B), Composable Scope from Previous Query (15.C), YAML DSL `fromResultSet:` (15.E), Operational Hardening (15.G) |
| **31. System Guardian — Real-Time Agent-Side Guaranteed State** | Kernel-event-driven enforcement primitives, event guards (Registry / SCM / WFP / ETW / inotify / netlink / D-Bus / Endpoint Security), condition guards (process / software / compliance / WMI), pre-login activation, offline-capable cached policy, audit journal, dashboard, push protocol, signing, quarantine integration |

Plus the 19 existing "Not Started" items moved to "Done" = **~225 total, all done**.

## Part 6: What We Will NOT Build

Some Tachyon features are not worth replicating because Yuzu has superior alternatives:

| Tachyon Feature | Why Not | Yuzu Alternative |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| SCALE language interpreter | Massive effort, proprietary lock-in | WorkflowEngine + script_exec + plugin ABI |
| XML instruction definitions | Legacy format | YAML DSL (cleaner, more readable) |
| Windows-only authentication | Limits platform reach | OIDC/PKCE (universal) |
| SQL Server dependency | Ops burden, licensing cost | SQLite (embedded, zero-ops) |
| .NET Consumer SDK | Platform-specific | REST API + Python SDK + PowerShell module |
| TIMS desktop IDE | Desktop app maintenance burden | Web-based YAML editor (CodeMirror) |
| Nomad (full P2P suite) | Years of engineering | Simpler P2P mesh (Phase 14.1) |
| AI Auto-Curation | Requires ML training data | Manual curation + LLM-assisted (via MCP) |
| Shopping / Self-Service Portal | Full separate product | SoftwareDeploymentStore + approval workflow |
| Experience Analytics | Separate product | Prometheus metrics + Grafana |
