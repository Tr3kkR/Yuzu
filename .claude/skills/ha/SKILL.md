description: High Availability control plane for Yuzu — the canonical entry point for any work on ADR-2002 (active-active server tier, gateway-fronted routing, Postgres-backed coordination seam, HA Postgres storage). Use when the user says "/ha", "/high-availability", "/ha-matrix", asks to plan or implement an HA workstream (WS-0…WS-14), asks "what's our HA gap" or "is it safe to run a second replica yet", asks to audit HA readiness, or starts work touching the coordination seam (leader election / fenced epochs / transactional outbox), gateway intra-cluster routing, shared `AgentRegistry` presence, PKI/CA HA, or the `deploy/docker/*ha*` / `scripts/ha/` surface. The skill bundles the two-axis model, the safe-to-scale gate, the delivery matrix (current-state + reviewers + status), the per-workstream workflow, and the load order for the routed reference docs.

# High Availability skill

The single entry point for any HA work in Yuzu. Bundles three things:

1. **The model** — the two independent axes and the safe-to-scale gate (get
   this wrong and a second replica double-dispatches destructive commands).
2. **The delivery matrix** — every workstream WS-0…WS-14: what it delivers,
   current state, dependencies, whether it gates a second replica, routed
   reviewers, and status.
3. **Gap/priority + workflow** — what to build next and the standard
   procedure for landing a workstream slice.

This skill does NOT replace ADR-2002 or the routed docs. It tells you which
to load, in which order, and what to confirm before you start cutting code.
**On any conflict, ADR-2002 governs the model and
`docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md` governs delivery** — this file is a pointer and
loses to both.

---

## Usage

```
/ha                       # default: print the matrix + the safe-to-scale gate, ask which WS to work on
/ha audit                 # snapshot of HA readiness — which WS are done, whether a 2nd replica is safe yet
/ha plan <WS>             # plan-only walk-through for a single workstream (e.g. WS-3, WS-7)
/ha implement <WS>        # full workflow: plan → governance → implement → test → docs for one WS slice
```

If invoked without a subcommand, default to printing **the matrix (Section 2)
+ the safe-to-scale gate (Section 1)** and asking which workstream to work on.

---

## 1. The model — read before sequencing anything

Authoritative reference: `docs/adr/2002-high-availability-architecture.md`
(the decisions) and `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md` (the delivery spine). Read
them before this skill claims anything is "done."

### 1a. Two independent axes

- **Server-tier HA** — N presentation + core replicas (WS-0…WS-6, WS-8,
  WS-10, WS-11, WS-13).
- **Storage HA** — HA Postgres (WS-7). **A single Postgres is a valid,
  supported deployment; server-tier HA does not require it.**

"HA" as a *customer claim* = **both** axes + WS-9 (validation) + WS-11/WS-12
(operability). Do not conflate the axes: WS-7 shipping does not make the
server tier highly available, and a second replica is safe against a single
Postgres.

### 1b. ⚠️ The safe-to-scale gate (the load-bearing constraint)

**Do not equate "Phase A done" with "safe to run a second replica."** The
three-model adversarial review's strongest, unanimous finding:

> **A second server replica may be enabled only when WS-0, WS-1, WS-2(2a
> outbox), WS-3, WS-4, WS-5, WS-6, WS-10 are done, AND WS-8's per-tier
> `/readyz` exists.**

Miss any one and the failure is **not cosmetic**:
- No **WS-3** (fenced leader) → both replicas run the singleton workers →
  **double-dispatch of destructive commands** (software-deployment,
  quarantine, policy-remediation).
- No **WS-4/WS-5** → commands can't reach agents / scope evaluation drops
  agents on the replica lacking the local stream → **mis-targeting**.
- No **WS-6** → CRL numbering / enrollment **diverge** across replicas.

**WS-7 (HA Postgres) is NOT in this gate set** — it gates the storage axis
(no SPOF / RPO=0), not the second server replica. The "Gates 2nd replica?"
column in the matrix encodes this per row.

### 1c. Split ↔ HA — RATIFIED: decoupled (the split is NOT a prerequisite)

**Is the presentation/core split (ADR-0031) a prerequisite for active-active?
No — decoupled. Ratified by the ADR-1005 owner (Dave Rae), 2026-09-07.** Monolith
active-active is the target; the split is a parallel programme, not a gate for a
2nd replica. The one in-process blocker (direct agent `Subscribe` stream) is solved
by **gateway-fronting (WS-4)**, not the split.
- **Kimi's dissent (recorded, rebutted):** Kimi called the split a hard safety
  prerequisite. Every safety property it could mean — singleton double-dispatch
  (WS-3), in-memory sessions (WS-1a, **done**), stream routing (WS-4) — is closed in
  the monolith. What the split buys is presentation scale-out + separate readiness
  signals: **capacity, not safety.**
- **One-way dependency:** the split *consumes* HA (inherits WS-1 sessions, rides
  WS-2a's durable `event_outbox` for its event spine, takes MCP replay durability from
  WS-2b) — never the reverse. WS-2b spine and WS-8 tier-split `/readyz` are no-ops on
  the monolith and land with the split. Delivery lives in its own control plane:
  `docs/presentation-core-split-delivery-matrix.md` (the `/split` skill).

### 1d. Non-obvious model decisions (survived two+ adversarial reviews)

- **Coordination = a narrow seam, Postgres-backed by default** — fenced
  advisory-lock leader + LISTEN/NOTIFY-as-hint over a durable outbox +
  reconnect cursor-poll; pluggable for SaaS; ship one impl. No new SPOF
  (Postgres already bounds availability, ADR-0007 fail-closed).
- **Effectively-once, NOT exactly-once** — transactional outbox +
  claim-before-side-effect + receiver-side idempotency (agent/gateway dedup on
  `command_id`). A dup must **replay the terminal outcome**, never return a
  bare `REJECTED` (that is the "effect-once, result-maybe-lost" bug WS-0 closes).
- **Intra-cluster gateway routing is net-new work** — OTP `pg` is
  broadcast-only; per-agent lookup is node-local ETS. "pg finds the exact
  node" is false; per-agent distributed routing must be built (WS-4).
- **The routing directory must be fenced** — (agent_id, connection_epoch,
  cluster_id, session_id, lease_until) with CAS register/deregister, else a
  stale replay overwrites a newer re-home.
- **Sessions → durable Postgres (DB wall-clock)** reverses the as-built
  in-memory-monotonic design and owns the regression risk on JIT-elevation /
  MFA windows.
- **Durability is selectable; default 3-node quorum** (1 primary + 2 sync
  standbys, ANY 1) on **distinct failure domains** — unconditional 2-node
  RPO=0 was a footgun (single standby loss stalls all writes).
- **Model:** hybrid, general product capability (on-prem-first + SaaS-later),
  NOT one customer. **Gateway-fronting is mandatory in HA** (direct-connect
  kept for single-node). Don't assume HA Postgres.

## 2. The delivery matrix — current state, reviewers, status

Source of truth: `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md`. Read it before this skill
claims a status. WS-0…WS-10 come from ADR-2002 §Decomposition; WS-11…WS-14 are
delivery/ops workstreams the three-model review surfaced as missing.

**WS-6 re-stamped 2026-09-23 (PR #4833):** slice 6.1 (cross-replica CRL publication, #4126) in
review; 6.1b / 6.2 / 6.3 planned; the operator decisions (shared CA key custody, not
`SecretCodec`; a one-time `.cfg` enrollment import) are recorded in ADR-2002 §8 "Update
(2026-09-23)".

**Verified 2026-09-21 (against `origin/dev`): DONE — WS-0 (#3662), WS-1 (1a+1b+1c),
WS-2a (2a-1 + 2a-2 #3924), WS-3 (3.1–3.4 — #4011/#4134/#4169/#4194), WS-4 4.1 +
4.2a + 4.2b Tasks A–D (#4245/#4299/#4344/#4355, merged) + `#4324` per-home
stream-generation fence (PR #4492, merge commit `c37306113`, 2026-09-17T22:05:58Z,
**MERGED**), WS-7 (#3627), WS-10 10.1/10.2. **4.3a DONE** (intra-cluster `pg`-group
agent→node lookup + the `fanout_terminal` cross-node fix + `remote_dispatched`
telemetry — code-complete, empirically verified, no longer inert since `#4555`
merged). **`#4555` MERGED** (2026-09-19, `495cf24c4`, PR #4604): gateway cluster
formation (`yuzu_gw_cluster_discovery` always-on redial loop, DNS-A-record +
static-override discovery, dynamic address-only node identity, cookie length
floor) implemented, Fable-adjudicated, empirically verified against a real OTP
`peer` — see `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md`'s WS-4 row for the full mechanism.
**WS-4 4.4 DONE** (2026-09-20, ADR-2002 §7c): `gateway_node` convergence + the
`#4246` #6 replay-session writeback, closed after a Fable pre-implementation
review rejected the originally-proposed design and surfaced that
`ProxyRegister` was unconditionally wiping placement on every replay-adopted
registration (a live, single-replica bug, not just a multi-replica gap) — see
the blockquote below and ADR-2002 §7c for the full mechanism.
**WS-4 rest of 4.3 DONE** (2026-09-21, ADR-2002 §7d): cross-cluster gateway
fan-out — `AgentSession`/`GatewayPendingCmd` now carry `cluster_id` end-to-end
from the common `send_to`/`send_to_all` path (not just the 4.2b directory
fallback), a new eager `GatewayMgmtStubPool` dials the OWNING cluster per
command instead of the single legacy stub, `--gateway-cluster-addr` config,
a response-agent forgery guard (closes ONE forgery shape — a cluster answering
as a different agent — NOT a rogue gateway claiming an agent's own identity via
`ProxyRegister`, which needs no per-agent secret; **multi-cluster mode does NOT
yet provide trust-zone isolation between clusters for a given agent, tracked
as `#4669`, pr-rev-caught pre-merge**), and one small required Erlang fix
(`stream_responses/3` threads the real `command_id` so a gateway-side
"not connected on this cluster" error is no longer invisible). **Closes WS-4's
dial-selection half** — the durable re-drive-on-failure half of §7's design
remains open (`#4672`), and `#4669` above is a separate, not-yet-closed item
(non-blocking today: zero production multi-cluster deployments). The
remaining safe-to-scale gate items are WS-5, WS-6, WS-8-readyz. See the
blockquote below and ADR-2002 §7d for the full mechanism, including the 5
findings a pre-implementation Fable review caught before any code was written
(the original resolution rule would have broken every upgrade), and the
pr-rev (FortitudeEtc/Codex+Kimi) round that caught the response-forgery
overclaim plus two real code bugs (terminal-outcome double-counting; an
oversized `cluster_id` silently routing to the default cluster instead of
being rejected) before merge.
Next gate items: WS-5, WS-6, WS-8-readyz. Also open: `#4669`, `#4672`.**

### Hard invariants that must NOT regress when landing any WS

Pulled from ADR-2002 and the matrix's Definition-of-Done. Every WS PR checks:

- **Effectively-once, not exactly-once** — one effect *and* the original
  outcome across an agent bounce + a primary failover. A dup never loses the
  first result.
- **Fenced leadership** — a monotonic epoch is checked inside the claim
  transaction; a stale leader's writes are rejected. No singleton worker runs
  without holding the fence.
- **No committed event lost across failover** — events are durable (outbox)
  and replayable from a cursor on a *different* replica.
- **Routing directory is fenced** with CAS register/deregister — no stale
  replay overwrites a newer re-home.
- **RPO=0 across a host failure with 3-node quorum on distinct failure
  domains; quorum loss blocks writes (fail-closed)** — unless the operator has
  explicitly opted into degrade-to-async (WS-7's `YUZU_PG_SYNC_STRICT`).
- **A new background job is classified** (fenced-leader-only / replica-safe /
  disabled) in the WS-10 table before it can run under active-active.
- **Every WS is done only when it has a passing WS-9 scenario** (WS-9 is
  continuous, so this is not circular).

## 3. Gap / priority — what to build next

Prio in the matrix is **build-effort**; the **safe-to-scale gate** is the real
constraint. Delivery phases (dependency-ordered):

1. **Phase A — Foundation (build now, parallel where the ladder allows):**
   `WS-1` (state→PG; 1a/1b/1c pace on the migration ladder, *not* fully
   parallel), `WS-0` (agent idempotency+replay), `WS-2a` (durable outbox),
   `WS-10` (job-safety audit), and `WS-7` (HA-PG — storage axis, fully
   parallel; **DONE, PR #3627 merged**, unblocks WS-9's stack).
2. **Phase B — Multi-instance safety (ALL required before a 2nd replica):**
   `WS-3` (fenced leader), `WS-4` (gateway routing), `WS-5` (presence),
   `WS-6` (PKI), `WS-8`-readyz, `WS-13` (agent gateway-front rollout).
   **The split question (§1c) is RESOLVED — decoupled, ratified by the ADR-1005 owner (Dave Rae, 2026-09-07); the split does not gate a 2nd replica.**
3. **Phase C — Enable, validate, operate:** flip on the second replica;
   `WS-9` runs continuously throughout B/C; `WS-11` ships *with* the second
   replica; then `WS-12` (cutover/DR), `WS-14` (security/capacity). `WS-2b`
   (spine) and `WS-8` tier-split readyz land with the ADR-1005 split.

**Suggested next slices** (as of 2026-09-21 — `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md` row
cites are authoritative):
- **Done (dial-selection, the safe-to-scale gate's WS-4 item):** WS-0 (#3662), WS-1 (1a+1b+1c), WS-2a
  (2a-1 + 2a-2 #3924), WS-3 (3.1–3.4, #4011/#4134/#4169/#4194), **WS-4's
  dial-selection half** (4.1+4.2a+4.2b+`#4324`+`#4555` (gateway multi-node
  cluster formation, `495cf24c4`)+4.3a (intra-cluster `pg`-group agent→node
  lookup)+4.4 (`gateway_node` convergence + `#4246` #6 writeback, ADR-2002
  §7c)+rest-of-4.3 (cross-cluster gateway fan-out, ADR-2002 §7d)), WS-7
  (#3627), WS-10 10.1/10.2. The storage axis is complete. **WS-4 is NOT
  entirely done** — two named items remain open and are tracked, not
  disclosed-only: `#4669` (multi-cluster mode has no agent↔cluster
  affinity/peer-identity binding, so it does not yet provide trust-zone
  isolation — caught by pr-rev, FortitudeEtc/Codex+Kimi, pre-merge on the
  rest-of-4.3 PR) and `#4672` (§7's durable outbox re-drive was never wired
  into `forward_gateway_pending`'s terminal-failure branches). Neither blocks
  the safe-to-scale gate today (multi-cluster mode has zero production
  deployments; the re-drive gap is inherited from before 4.3, not introduced
  by it), but do not read "WS-4 done" as "WS-4's every design goal closed."
- The **highest-leverage next** is now the remaining gate set directly:
  **WS-5** (presence — durable cross-replica session lookup; NOT unblocked by
  4.3's own work, contra an earlier version of this note — 4.3 built the
  per-cluster DIAL mechanism, not the durable cross-replica READ WS-5 needs),
  **WS-6** (PKI), **WS-8**-readyz (P0). A loss-free cross-replica reconnect
  (durable outbox replay) is the open 2a-2 follow-up.

**Shared with ADR-1005 (do not duplicate):** engine-tier HA (incl. NVD/CVE
sync, withdrawn from WS-1), the MCP Decision-15 pre-commitments WS-2 inherits,
and the presentation/core split (WS-2b + WS-8 tier-split readyz land with it).

## 4. Standard workflow for a workstream slice

For every WS in the matrix:

1. **Read first, in order:**
   - This skill (gap framing + the safe-to-scale gate).
   - `docs/ha-delivery-matrix.md` for the row's current-state cites +
     dependencies + reviewers.
   - `docs/adr/2002-high-availability-architecture.md` for the decision the
     slice must satisfy (the ADR governs on any conflict).
   - `docs/postgres-migration-ladder.md` for any WS-1/store-migration slice
     (it is the authoritative per-store status).
   - `docs/adr-1005-execution-plan.md` if the slice touches a shared seam
     (presentation/core split, engine tier, MCP Decision-15).

2. **Plan.** Produce a short plan covering: the ADR-2002 guarantee it delivers;
   whether it is in the safe-to-scale gate set; schema changes (via
   `MigrationRunner` / the PG store playbook); the fence/epoch or
   idempotency/outbox mechanism if applicable; and the **WS-9 scenario** it
   must add (a WS is not done without one).

3. **The split question (§1c) is RESOLVED** — decoupled, ratified by the ADR-1005
   owner (Dave Rae, 2026-09-07). Phase-B proceeds on the monolith track; no per-slice re-confirmation needed.

4. **Implement** as a focused PR per slice, in an isolated worktree off `dev`.
   Drive schema through `MigrationRunner` / `docs/postgres-store-playbook.md`,
   fencing through the `LeaderElector` epoch contract, and receiver dedup
   through the agent/gateway `command_id` path.

5. **Test.** Run `/test` before commit; add the WS-9 failover scenario and run
   the failover harness (`scripts/ha/` for the storage axis). Note WS-7-class
   deploy-only changes are a `/test` no-op — CI's build legs + the harness are
   the real gate there.

6. **Governance.** Run `/governance dev..HEAD` before pushing — the routed
   reviewers in the WS row are unconditional (e.g. `cpp-safety` on any fencing
   /ownership change, `security-guardian` on the coordination substrate,
   `gateway-erlang` on WS-4). CRITICAL/HIGH block merge. **Self-adversarial
   review (Sol / Kimi) before pushing review-fixes on HA work** — it has
   repeatedly caught blocking findings a reviewer would hit next round.

7. **Docs + evidence.** docs-writer picks up user-manual / ops-runbook updates
   in Gate 2; ship them in the same PR. For the coordination substrate,
   WS-14's threat/capacity notes and a `docs/security-reviews/` record apply.
