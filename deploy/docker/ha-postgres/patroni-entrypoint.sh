# and launch Patroni as the `postgres` OS user (WS-7, ADR-2002 §11).

# durability profile and per-node identity are driven entirely by env vars —
# the same image is every node in the cluster.

#   PATRONI_NAME             this node's unique name (e.g. pg1)         [required]
#   PATRONI_CONNECT_HOST     hostname other nodes/HAProxy reach us on   [default: $PATRONI_NAME]
#   ETCD_HOSTS               comma-list host:port of the etcd cluster   [required]
#   POSTGRES_USER            bootstrap superuser name                   [default: postgres]
#   POSTGRES_PASSWORD        bootstrap superuser password               [required]
#   YUZU_PG_REPLICATION_PASSWORD  replication-role password             [required]
#   YUZU_DB_USER/NAME/PASSWORD    app role/db/password — consumed by the
#                            inherited post_init init script, NOT here  [required]
#   YUZU_PG_DURABILITY       quorum3 (default) | sync2 | async          [default: quorum3]
#   YUZU_PG_SYNC_STRICT      fail-closed on total standby loss          [default: false]
#   YUZU_PG_TRUST_CIDR       CIDR allowed host (TCP) connections        [default: 0.0.0.0/0]
