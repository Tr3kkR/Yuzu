  Test-ProvisionLogic.ps1 — hand-run regression tests for the decision logic in
  Provision-Windows-Runner.ps1.

  Provisioning is the one script here that cannot be exercised in CI: it is
  elevated, Windows-only, and its whole job is mutating live shared state on the
  runner box. Reviews of it are therefore static, and PR #2359's review round 2
  landed a blocker (a drain check that was a point-in-time snapshot, gating on
  the wrong process, placed after an unguarded service restart) that no static
  read had caught in round 1. This file exists so the guard rails that came out
  of that round have an executable check.

  Scope, honestly: this covers the maintenance gate, the -D data-dir handling,
  the ImagePath rewrite, and a set of structural invariants over the script's
  own AST. It does NOT execute provisioning — nothing here proves a real
  robocopy, service repoint or cluster restart works. Round 3 of the PR #2359
  review found two live blockers while an earlier version of this suite reported
  all-green, because one assertion compared the first gate call against the
  first restart and so passed trivially; treat green here as "the specific
  regressions below are absent", never as "provisioning is correct".

  It is SAFE TO RUN ANYWHERE: no elevation, no machine state. Function bodies
  are extracted from the real script via the AST (never copied, so they cannot
  drift), Get-CimInstance is mocked, the registry work uses a throwaway HKCU key
  that is deleted afterwards, and the end-to-end suite runs the real script
  prologue truncated just before the first Step.

  Run it after ANY change to the maintenance gate, the -D data-dir handling, or
  the service ImagePath rewrite:
